And boy did that suddenly take me back to my favorite, scholarly, pale skinned royal family. \n\nOh and did you know that Radahn really loved his horse. He never got off the damn thing. He even studied gravity sorcery just so that he could forever ride the horse even after he got too big. Nothing else there. \n\nAnd what was up with Rykard. The game seems to note his aging physique. His faded red hair with a pale silver strand. Even though he's a demigod. He was aging, thats weird. \n\nRanni and Rennalla are technically never seen walking in their real bodies. \n\nEven the so called- Carian weed, who may not be Carian, Sellen, we never actually see her stand in her real body, but maybe im getting too ahead of myself.\n\nWere they cursed? Who knows. Regardless, I have my eyes on them.",

    "body": "Lore in Elden Ring\u00a0covers all the information related to the world and mythos of the game. From past events that occurred long ago, to the history of the\u00a0Lands Between and the mystery of the elusive Elden Ring, all can be found here. Please note that this page contains heavy spoilers.\n\nThe Shadow of the Erdtree DLC for Elden Ring takes players into the mysterious Realm of Shadow, a dark, death-filled version of the Lands Between. Hidden beneath a shrouded cloud south of the Erdtree on the original map, this eerie realm is marked by ghostly tombstones, coffins, and the Scadutree, a shadowy counterpart to the Erdtree. The story revolves around the conflicts and ambitions of key figures, including Miquella, Messmer, and St. Trina, while exploring the complicated history of factions like the Hornsent.\n\nMiquella, cursed with eternal youth, plays a central role in the DLC as he seeks to complete a ritual to achieve godhood. To accomplish this, he plans to capture Radahn's soul and place it in Mohg's body, using his rebirth as a means to stand at the gates of divinity. His connection to St. Trina, revealed in the DLC, shows that they are two manifestations of the same being, much like the duality of Radagon and Marika. Throughout the journey, players encounter crosses scattered across the Realm of Shadow that symbolize the pieces of Miquella's being he sheds to prepare for rebirth.\n\nMessmer, the son of Marika and brother to Miquella and Malenia, also has a significant role. Cursed with the Abyssal Serpent inside him, Messmer was tasked with purging the tower-dwelling Hornsent in the Realm of Shadow. The Hornsent, known as Omens in the Lands Between, represent an older religion that predates Marika's rule. Despite being abandoned by Marika, Messmer continues his mission and becomes an imposing figure in the DLC's narrative.\n\nPlayers meet several key NPCs from different factions during their journey. These include Needle Knight Leda, a loyal follower of Miquella, Freyja, a warrior who once fought alongside Radahn, the Hornsent, a representative of the tower-dwelling faction, and Sir Ansbach, a former servant of Mohg. Early in the DLC, it is revealed that all these characters were united under Miquella's charm. When Miquella intentionally breaks a rune arc to free them from his influence, the group becomes divided and uncertain, revealing a darker side to Miquella's manipulative nature.\n\nThe DLC also deepens the mysteries surrounding St. Trina, an enigmatic figure only briefly mentioned in the base game. Interacting with St. Trina and her follower, Thiollier, uncovers her connection to Miquella and hints at the sacrifices required for his quest. Themes of identity, ambition, and rebirth run throughout the story as players uncover the complex motivations and actions of the characters involved.\n\nLand of Shadow is a mysterious and dark realm obscured by the Erdtree, where the goddess Marika first set foot. It is a place filled with secrets and dangers, with vast maps, dungeons, and enemies to encounter. The lore behind this DLC suggests that players will explore the Land of Shadow guided by Empyrean Miquella, meeting others who follow him with their own motives.\n\nSir Ansbach is a former servant of Mohg, Lord of Blood, but now follows Miquella in the Realm of Shadow. He was once part of the Pureblood Knights, but over time, the embroidered crest on his armor has almost completely faded. Despite knowing that his loyalty to his old master is neither logical nor just, Ansbach still holds onto his oath. This shows his deep inner struggle, as he feels unable to let it go. His attire slightly boosts his abilities related to blood magic and dynastic skills.\n\nIn battle, Ansbach is known for his Furious Blade of Ansbach, an incantation that summons a bloodflame blade from his hand. He then lunges at enemies to strike them down. If charged, the attack becomes even stronger, allowing him to deliver multiple slashes in quick succession. Unlike the graceful sword techniques of his dynasty, Ansbach's fighting style is more aggressive, reflecting the fearsome reputation he's earned over time.\n\nAnsbach also wields the Obsidian Lamina, a sharp, slender scythe. This weapon relies on skill rather than tricks, and it allows him to cut through enemies with brutal precision. The scythe is a deadly tool in Ansbach's hands, leaving a trail of blood across the battlefield. It's a symbol of both his skill in combat and his connection to a past that he can't fully escape.\n\nRedmane Freyja is a former loyalist of General Radahn, one of the greatest warriors in the lands, but she has since become a devoted follower of Miquella. Known for her strength and valor, she once fought alongside Radahn, earning a place among his most distinguished knights. Freyja's armor is adorned with a black woolen mantle and the golden markings of her past, symbolizing her distinguished position in Radahn's ranks. Her helmet bears the scar of a scarlet wound, a reminder of her painful past, which was later healed by Miquella's touch, leaving a permanent scar that Freyja now views as her guiding compass.\n\nFreyja wields a Greatsword, decorated with a mane, reflecting both her connection to Radahn and her strength as a warrior. The blade enhances her battle skills, a testament to her intense training and unyielding resolve. Alongside this, she carries the Golden Lion Shield, a symbol of Radahn's personal guard, awarded to only the most valorous of his knights. Her loyalty to Radahn was so great that she was honored with these weapons, but her heart has since turned toward Miquella's cause.\n\nIn her dialogues, Freyja speaks with respect and a sense of duty. When first meeting the Tarnished, she recalls her past with Radahn, speaking of the battles they fought together and her readiness to fight again. She also urges the Tarnished to follow the footprints of Miquella, pointing to a path that she herself walks now. Freyja has a deep bond with Miquella, describing how the god healed her scarlet rot and gave her a new sense of purpose. She expresses a sense of duty to Miquella and a need to understand the vow that Miquella made with Radahn, which she believes must be honored.\n\nThroughout her interactions, Freyja maintains a warrior's mentality, proud of her combat prowess and ready to face any challenge. She speaks candidly about her past, her current loyalties, and the changes in her life after her scarlet rot was healed. In moments of reflection, she acknowledges the complexity of her path, particularly when dealing with former allies like Sir Ansbach, and the possibility of fighting alongside or against old comrades in battle. Her unwavering commitment to Miquella, however, remains her guiding force as she seeks to carve her destiny on the battlefield.\n\nThe Hornsent is both a singular character and a race of people in Elden Ring, hailing from the Realm of Shadow. The character Hornsent, who is found alongside Freyja at the Three-Path Cross in Gravesite Plain, represents the larger group of Hornsent, who were purged by Messmer the Impaler. Hornsent holds a deep grudge against the Erdtree, which they view as an enemy of their people, as well as Marika, whom they see as having betrayed them. Despite their hatred, Hornsent follows an oath to Miquella and offers the player assistance, urging them to pursue Miquella's goals if they wish to avoid being considered an enemy.\n\nHornsent's people, the Hornsent, are characterized by their suffering and resentment. As the player aligns with Miquella, Hornsent provides maps of the crosses they've found, which mark significant locations tied to their people's pain and suffering. They express belief in Miquella's redemption, though their focus remains on avenging the wrongs done to them. Hornsent refuses to accept alms or gifts, displaying a sense of pride, but if the player aids them in their mission, Hornsent will reward them with maps and guidance.\n\nHornsent's dialogue reflects their ongoing struggle for vengeance, particularly against Messmer, who is seen as the primary source of their people's torment. After the death of Messmer, Hornsent expresses a mix of satisfaction and continuing thirst for vengeance, indicating that their quest for retribution extends beyond the Impaler to Marika and the entire Erdtree. Despite moments of vulnerability, such as when they lament the inability to enact vengeance alone, Hornsent remains unwavering in their pursuit of justice for their people.\n\nIgon, the broken drake warrior, is a tragic and vengeful character in Elden Ring, his soul consumed by pain and a burning need for revenge against the dread dragon Bayle. Severely injured and broken, Igon can be heard screaming in agony, cursing the dragon for the torment he endures, vowing vengeance. He created his own weapon, Igon's Harpoon, a great arrow adorned with sharp gravel stone pieces specifically designed to be deadly against dragons, with the hope that Bayle himself would feel fear. The harpoon represents Igon's obsession and relentless drive to defeat Bayle, even if it means fighting from beyond the grave.\n\nIgon's armor, Igon's Set, is a mismatched and tattered collection of battle-worn pieces that reflect his past as a scavenger on the battlefield. Each item, such as the helm shaped like a bugle, the filthy armor, and the tattered gauntlets and loincloth, tells the story of a warrior who once sought honor through Dragon Communion. Despite the poor condition of his gear, Igon finds strength in his connection to the Dragon Communion, a bond that fuels his thirst for revenge.\n\nOne of Igon's most personal items is the Igon's Furled Finger, a gnarled and discolored finger that can be used to summon him to battle. In his suffering, Igon's soul still clings to the mountain where his battle with Bayle occurred, and he asks the player to scale the jagged peak to face the dragon, summoning him in a final act of defiance. Igon's Greatbow, another weapon forged in his agony, is crafted from dragon bones bound with rope and scarred by claws. The bow, much like his harpoon, is imbued with his hatred for Bayle, enhancing the power of his deadly harpoons.\n\nIgon's dialogue further paints the picture of his pain and resolve. He repeatedly speaks of the exquisite pain that keeps him alive, taunting Bayle with promises of revenge. Upon encountering the player, he expresses both his agony and his unwavering desire to avenge himself, pleading for the end of his torment. When the player defeats Jagged Peak Drake, Igon briefly reflects on the past, reminding himself of the warrior he once was, before asking the player to continue the fight against Bayle on his behalf. In his final moments, Igon's words reflect both his strength as a drake warrior and the despair that drives him to seek vengeance beyond death.\n\nWhen asked about Igon, the Dragon Communion Priestess reflects on his ambition and the insatiable hunger that led him to Dragon Communion, comparing him to Bayle in his fiery spirit and relentless drive. Igon's obsession with Bayle eventually culminates in a vow to bring the dragon to its knees, even if it means sacrificing every last bit of his strength. In the end, after Bayle is defeated, Igon's spirit is freed, and he can finally rest, knowing that his revenge has been realized.\n\nMoore is a gentle giant and a follower of Miquella, serving as both a merchant and a member of the Forager Brood. This group of friendly pests is dedicated to searching for crafting materials and recipes across the Land of Shadow. Moore can first be encountered at the Main Gate Cross Site of Grace, near Belurat Tower Settlement, where he is accompanied by Sir Ansbach. After speaking to Moore and purchasing an item from him, you gain access to further dialogue with both Moore and Sir Ansbach. Moore's role as a merchant is intertwined with his devotion to Miquella, the Kind, and his desire to spread joy by finding things that can help others.\n\nMoore is deeply connected to his Forager Brood and expresses a strong fondness for finding things to share with others. He speaks of Miquella with great reverence and kindness, even as the group faces various trials. When the Great Rune breaks, Moore is visibly affected, yet he continues to stand tall, clinging to his devotion to Miquella, despite the loss of light. Moore's dialogue reflects his uncertainty and sadness at the absence of a motherly figure, with moments where he questions whether to remain sad forever or to move forward, embracing the idea that Miquella's love can heal all pain.\n\nWhen interacting with Moore after meeting Thiollier, he expresses his joy in fulfilling a task, offering a Black Syrup that Thiollier had asked him to find. If the player helps a forager brood, Moore is quick to show his gratitude, offering his thanks on behalf of the group. However, his gentle nature is tested when tragedy strikes. If a forager brood member is killed, Moore is deeply troubled, and the death cannot be forgiven in his eyes. Similarly, when players invade or harm one of the foragers, Moore reacts with anger, calling it an unforgivable tragedy.\n\nIn moments of personal reflection, Moore shows vulnerability, particularly after the defeat of the final boss when he laments the loss of his brood and the absence of those he once considered allies, like Lady Leda, Father Dane, Sir Ansbach, Freyja, Thiollier, and the hornsent. In his solitude, Moore expresses his gratitude for the player's visits, highlighting the sadness that surrounds him after the disbandment of his brood. His final moments of dialogue express a quiet sorrow, as he wonders whether his brood's existence was ever truly meaningful. Regardless of the circumstances, Moore remains loyal to Miquella and his mission, driven by the hope that Miquella's light will someday return to guide them all.\n\nNeedle Knight Leda is the leader of Miquella's band of followers in the Realm of Shadow. She is found at the Highroad Cross Site of Grace, located near Hornsent. Leda is devoted to Miquella, whom she believes guides her along the righteous path. Upon first meeting the player, she speaks of her faith in Miquella, urging them to touch the withered arm, which serves as a portal to the Realm of Shadow, where Miquella now resides. She mentions that her companions, similarly drawn to Miquella, can provide aid if the player finds them.\n\nIn further dialogue, Leda emphasizes the strong bond that unites her group, which consists of individuals from distant lands. Despite their varied backgrounds, they are united in their shared devotion to Miquella. She references a silent monk named Dane, who has been serving Miquella longer than her, explaining that although he is reserved, he is a formidable warrior. Leda also discusses the hornsent, hinting at a tumultuous past between their people and the tower folk, a result of ancient conflicts instigated by Queen Marika's commands.\n\nAfter the Great Rune is broken, Leda's character undergoes a shift. Her devotion to Miquella remains unwavering, but the breaking of Miquella's enchantment causes her to grow suspicious of her fellow followers. Leda begins to question their loyalty and proposes that the hornsent, whose desire for vengeance may jeopardize Miquella's influence, should be eliminated. In the ensuing confrontation, Leda expresses her belief that the hornsent's hatred could eventually turn against Miquella, necessitating his removal. If the player assists Leda in defeating the hornsent, she remarks on the importance of this action, claiming that the hornsent will no longer pose a threat to Miquella's cause.\n\nAs the story progresses, Leda's trust issues extend to other members of the group. She identifies Sir Ansbach, a former commander of the Pureblood Knights, as another individual whose loyalty may falter in the absence of Miquella's influence. Leda expresses her intention to deal with him as well, asserting that his past involvement with Miquella's blood blade makes him a potential danger.\n\nLeda's story culminates in her final confrontation with the player. After the defeat of Sir Ansbach, Leda reflects on her actions, contemplating the weight of her deeds. However, she acknowledges that this is the price of ensuring Miquella's continued favor. If the player chooses to confront Leda, she will reveal the full extent of her deadly abilities, vowing to eliminate anyone who stands against Miquella's will. Whether as an ally or adversary, Leda's path is marked by unwavering devotion, suspicion, and the willingness to enforce her vision of Miquella's will at any cost.\n\nThiollier is a non-combatant character in Elden Ring, known for his expertise in crafting poison rather than fighting. He can be found at the Pillar Path Cross - Site of Grace, where he can be interacted with as a merchant. Thiollier is a Tarnished, like the player, and he serves under Miquella, a figure to whom he is deeply devoted. Despite his loyalty, Thiollier is self-deprecating and openly admits his physical weakness and lack of combat prowess. He confesses that he has always been frail, but finds solace in his ability to craft poison, which is his primary skill.\n\nWhen first encountered, Thiollier speaks of Miquella and mentions Lady Leda, acknowledging the player's guidance under the same deity. He offers assistance in various ways, and his dialogue includes hints of his personal struggles and his fascination with sleep and death. After the Great Rune is broken, Thiollier becomes more reflective, haunted by memories of St. Trina, the goddess of slumber. He expresses a longing for the poison associated with St. Trina, believing it will grant him eternal sleep, and he asks the player to help him fulfill his desire by finding St. Trina's resting place.\n\nThiollier's obsession with St. Trina leads him to follow the player's advice and seek out her location in the southern part of the world. Upon finding her, he falls deeper into his obsession, drifting into a state of intoxicated slumber, lost in his thoughts of St. Trina. As his journey progresses, Thiollier becomes increasingly erratic, demanding more of the poison to help him reach his final resting state. However, he warns the player not to follow his example, as the poison would plunge them into an eternal slumber.\n\nAfter a series of interactions, including consuming the poison himself, Thiollier becomes more delusional, believing that only he deserves to hear St. Trina's voice. If the player tries to speak for St. Trina, Thiollier reacts with anger, accusing the player of lying and betraying him. This hostility escalates, leading to a final confrontation where Thiollier becomes even more unhinged in his pursuit of his goddess. In battle, Thiollier's poison attacks are his primary method of defense, and his words often reflect his obsessive loyalty to St. Trina.\n\nThiollier's interactions with other characters, such as Needle Knight Leda and Sir Ansbach, also reveal his role in the larger narrative. Leda acknowledges Thiollier's devotion to St. Trina, though she fears his loyalty to Miquella may be secondary. Sir Ansbach, though initially dismissive of Thiollier's apparent frailty, later praises his strength in service to his cause. Thiollier's loyalty is tested throughout the game, and his final moments reflect his unyielding desire to serve St. Trina above all else.\n\nThiollier's dialogue also hints at a deep sense of loss and isolation. As he laments the absence of his fellow followers, including Lady Leda and Sir Moore, he wonders where they have all gone. His tragic story is one of devotion, obsession, and a search for eternal peace, making him a memorable and complex character in Elden Ring.\n\nHornsent Grandam is a character in Elden Ring, belonging to the ancient race that once thrived in Belurat, Tower Settlement. Her people, known for their rich history and connection to the sacred Divine Beast Dancing Lion, were decimated by Messmer the Impaler and his forces. Now one of the few remaining members of her kind, Grandam serves as a tragic reminder of the destruction wrought upon her homeland. She is encountered within the ruins of her settlement, harboring deep resentment toward outsiders, whom she initially mistakes as allies of her people's oppressors.\n\nWhen first approached, Hornsent Grandam greets the Tarnished with suspicion and bitterness, accusing them of complicity in the atrocities committed by Messmer. Her dialogue reflects her anguish, lamenting the destruction of her race and vowing that justice will be delivered through the wrath of the Divine Beast. Her words are steeped in contempt, often cursing the player and questioning their intentions, especially if they hesitate to confront the beast.\n\nDryleaf Dane is a master of hand-to-hand combat and a devoted follower of Miquella, renowned for his unarmed martial prowess and ascetic discipline. As a sworn ally of Leda and a prominent figure of the Dryleaf Sect, Dane embodies the sect's ideals of self-sufficiency and inner strength. His martial art, Dane's Footwork, is a unique combat style emphasizing powerful and precise kicks, developed through years of rigorous training under a waterfall. By enduring the relentless force of the water and immersing himself in its basin, Dane forged both his physical endurance and spiritual resolve.\n\nTravelers seeking to learn the ways of the Dryleaf Sect may encounter a Monk's Missive, a cryptic letter left by Dane. The missive invites challengers to seek him in the eastern lands, where they must prove their worth through a direct and silent confrontation. Combat with Dane is not just a test of skill but a trial of character, as his teachings are reserved only for those who embody the sect's values of self-reliance and perseverance.\n\nCount Ymir, the High Priest of Manus Metyr Cathedral, is a significant figure in Elden Ring, offering a variety of sorceries and lore insights to players. He oversees the Cathedral of Manus Metyr and serves as a vendor for glintstone spells, which can be purchased using runes. Ymir is deeply tied to the stars and their mysteries, often sharing philosophical musings about the Greater Will, the Erdtree, and the flaws within the world. He also provides players with maps to hallowed ruins, guiding them to crucial locations tied to their fate. Early in his questline, he gifts the Hole-Laden Necklace and a Ruins Map, marking the start of a journey shaped by the stars.\n\nYmir's companion, Jol\u00e1n, plays a critical role in his story. She can be summoned during specific encounters once her questline has been advanced. Ymir speaks highly of Jol\u00e1n, acknowledging her sharp demeanor while hinting at the hardships she has endured.\n\nAs players progress, Ymir reveals his disillusionment with the Erdtree and Marika, lamenting the world's inherent flaws and humanity's inability to find redemption. His dialogue is rich with lore, offering profound insights into the nature of the Greater Will, Miquella, and the celestial forces that influence the Lands Between. Depending on the player's actions, such as sounding the bells at the Finger Ruins, Ymir provides additional items like Beloved Stardust and updated maps that guide players further in their journey.\n\nThe Dragon Communion Priestess is a unique NPC in Elden Ring, serving as a surviving Ancient Dragon and an ardent worshipper of Dragonlord Placidusax. Found in a secluded shrine surrounded by remnants of dragonkind's former glory, she acts as a key figure in unraveling the lore of the Ancient Dragons.\n\nAs a devoted priestess, she provides players with valuable information about the fearsome dragon Bayle and her revered lord, Placidusax. Through her dialogue, the Priestess reveals the storied legacy of the dragons, their former dominion, and their eventual decline. Her presence ties deeply into the themes of Dragon Communion and offers players a chance to connect with the mystical and ancient power of the dragon lineage.\n\nJol\u00e1n is a loyal warrior who serves Count Ymir, the High Priest of Manus Metyr. She can be found in the Cathedral of Manus Metyr, standing on a pillar to the right of Count Ymir in the same room where players first meet him. Jol\u00e1n is initially cold and uninterested in talking to the player, focusing only on her duty to Count Ymir. She warns the player that crossing him will bring regret but shows some respect if the player gains Ymir's trust.\n\nJol\u00e1n speaks highly of Count Ymir, calling him a guiding \"star\" in the dark sky. She believes that Ymir is the only true light in the night, and her loyalty to him is unshakable. As the player continues their journey, Jol\u00e1n's attitude softens slightly, but her loyalty to Ymir remains. If the player betrays or harms Count Ymir, Jol\u00e1n will turn against them and fight to protect her lord's will.\n\nFire Knight Queelign is an NPC introduced in the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring. He is a knight who pledges his loyalty to Queen Marika, and his story is closely tied to the crusades fought in her name. Fire Knight Queelign is first encountered as an NPC Invader in both the Belurat Tower Settlement and the Church of Crusade.\n\nIn battle, Queelign wields a unique greatsword known as Queelign's Greatsword, a heavy weapon with a blade that undulates like fire. This weapon was remade by Queelign in the shape of the lance once wielded by his liege, symbolizing his dedication to the crusade and his desire to become a second Impaler, a figure revered in the fight for Marika's cause.\n\nQueelign's spirit can be summoned using the Fire Knight Queelign item, an ashen remains that allows the player to call forth his ghostly form. When summoned, Queelign attacks immediately with his spear-like greatsword, which impales foes with fire while protecting the purity of Marika. His attacks are relentless, reflecting his undying devotion to his queen and the crusade.\n\nSt. Trina is an NPC introduced in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC for Elden Ring. She is located in the deepest part of Stone Coffin Fissure, within the Garden of Deep Purple. Though she makes her first appearance in the DLC, St. Trina was referenced in the base game through various item descriptions, including St. Trina's Torch, which hinted at her connection to the lore and events surrounding Miquella, a key figure in the game's storyline.\n\nWhen players interact with St. Trina after imbibing nectar multiple times, she expresses deep concern over Miquella's fate. Her dialogue reveals her perspective on Miquella's potential godhood, suggesting that it would be a curse rather than a blessing. She first implores players to stop Miquella from ascending to godhood, believing that turning him into a god would ultimately trap him in a form of prison, rendering him beyond saving. If the player continues, St. Trina's dialogue becomes more desperate, urging them to kill Miquella and grant him forgiveness for the tragedy that his divinity would bring.\n\nThe storyteller folds her slender hands - both pairs - and speaks. \u201cIt happened an age ago. But when I recall, I see it true.\u201d So begins the tale of the Shattering, a devastating war between the children of Marika, Demigods of the Lands Between. One grim night in the depths of winter, a flock of unknown assassins stole across the Lands Between.\n\nIn a coetaneous attack, this foul covenant snuffed out the lives of many of the God-Queen's kin throughout the empire, too numerous and too scattered for her godly protection to save. The assassins' targets were multifold, but none was as devastating a loss to the Eternal Queen as that of Godwyn the Golden. After his death, the Elden Ring was somehow shattered, and the order of the world broke with it.\n\nOut of this chaos came war. Open, bitter war, pitting blood against blood and kin against kin. The conflict broke a vast and prosperous empire into brittle fragments. No single side could find enough purchase to maintain a decisive victory, even when fueled by the power of a Great Rune.\n\nThe battle of General Radahn against Malenia the Severed illustrated that neither strength nor skill alone would be enough to take control of the entirety of the lands Marika had united. And so, the Lands Between are no longer gripped by open war, but caught in an uneasy stalemate that seems impossible to resolve. \u201cUnless of course,\u201d the storyteller says, a coy smile on both her lips, \u201cthou shouldst take the crown?\u201d\n\nTake a deeper dive into the carefully crafted mythology of George R.R. Martin \u2013 author of\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0best-selling fantasy series,\u00a0A Song of Ice and Fire\u00a0\u2013 and the world created by FromSoftware based on his work\u00a0in this new trailer available here.\n\nTransported to ages long ago, you will relive the Shattering, a war that brought darkness to the Lands Between, initiated by demigods' hunger for power. You'll fight alongside General Radahn and Malenia the Severed, but even these two undefeatable warriors couldn't reunite a world so badly broken. There is only one hope left: the hope that a new Elden Lord will rise and lift the veil of shadows that has fallen over Marika's domain.\n\nThe wait is almost over. Soon you'll venture into the Lands Between and strive to become its Elden Lord. Stand ready, Tarnished, and prepare to claim what fate has promised you.\n\nIt happened an age ago.But when I recall, I see it true.\n\nThe rune of death was stolenAnd the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden.Queen Marika was driven to the brink.\n\nThe Shattering ensued; a war that wrought only darkness.\n\nThe Elden Ring was broken, but by whom? And why?What could the Demigods ever hope to win by warring?\n\nThe conqueror of the stars, General Radahn.And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed.\n\nThese two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat.But there would be no victor.\n\nAnd so, we inhabit a fractured world.Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord.\n\nRise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between.\n\nIn the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal, the Elden Ring, the source of the Erdtree, has been shattered.\n\nMarika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring\u00a0known as the Great Runes, and the mad taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering. A war that meant abandonment by the Greater Will.\n\nAnd now the guidance of grace will be brought to the Tarnished who were spurned by the grace of gold and exiled from the Lands Between. Ye dead who yet live, your grace long lost, follow the path to the Lands Between beyond the foggy sea to stand before the Elden Ring.\n\nThey will fight. And they will die. In an unending curse\n\nTarnished of the Lands BetweenThe Golden Order has been shattered. Throughout the Lands Between, Demigods holding shards of the Elden Ring squabble and make war over the ruins of a perfect realm, now abandoned by the golden guidance of the Greater Will.\n\nAs the echoes of this conflict[SIC] thunder in the distance, an outcast arrives. Once, their ancestors called the Lands Between home, but the blessed light of grace was lost to their tribe long ago and they were expelled from the kingdom. They are the Tarnished, and they have returned to claim the Elden Lordship promised to them by legend.\n\nThis is the world of ELDEN RING. As a Tarnished, the Lands Between await your exploration. You will ride through the vast fields, gallop over rolling hills, and leap to the top of rocky crags on your ephemeral steed, revealing a world teeming with life and danger.\n\nIn the grand fields where your journey begins, mythic creatures prowl the veldts, ineffable horrors lurk in the bogs and marshes, and all manner of soldiers and itinerant warriors are waiting for those who wander unawares. Shy creatures nibble on sweet grasses or scuttle through the underbrush.\n\nThose few inhabitants who are not mad or hostile linger near the broken remnants of cities left behind by the Shattering. They may have answers for you, if you help them. Above them all, ensconced in vast legacies bristling with traps, secrets, and guardians, the Demigods \u2013 warped Lords who began as members of a royal and noble family \u2013 rule their domains with the unyielding power granted by shards of the Elden Ring.\n\nThe guidance of lost graces \u2013 should you find them - will put you on a road to re-take these lands from the Demigods through might and magic, but you need not follow their path.\n\nThe choice is yours. Do you crave power, or do you seek understanding? Decide for yourself, then build your character as you see fit.\n\nTry dozens of skills and find one to best suit your style. Practice stealth to avoid danger or catch enemies unaware. Use the environment, the weather, and the time of day to gain an advantage. Learn the art of combat , where you must read your enemy's intentions and a well-timed dodge or parry could be the difference between life and death. Ride your steed into battle against mounted mercenaries and cut them from their horses. Master arcane spells from the masters that still linger among the ruins of the war. Summon familiar spirits to even the odds against you or call on your fellow Tarnished to fight at your side and share the burden as you explore. Or, delve into the complex, bloody history of the Shattering and discover the lost secrets of the Demigods and their kin. All these paths are possible, and more. Ultimately, your journey will be defined by the strength of your own ambition. The greater your goals, the greater the challenge will be. Should you choose to claim the Lands Between as your birthright then yes, you must fight.\n\nThe Lands Between is the world of Elden Ring, and those who live in The Lands Between were blessed by Grace through the Elden Ring and the Erdtree. Those who were blessed by the Elden Ring are characterized by having a golden aura that can be seen in their eyes. However, at some point, some of those who were blessed lost their grace; they were exiled and labeled the Tarnished.\u00a0 As time passed, for unknown reasons, the Elden Ring was shattered and its shards were scattered across the Lands Between. The largest of these pieces were called Great Runes and were claimed by the six Demigod children of Queen Marika the Eternal,\u00a0causing them to inherit different powers and have been physically changed and twisted due to being corrupted by the power of these runes.\n\nThe Lands Between is\u00a0divided into 7 distinct areas,\n\nEach overseen by a Demigod, and features a central \"overworld\" that connects all of these areas. According to an interview with Miyazaki, players will have total freedom as to the order they want to tackle for each area, and it is up to the player on how they want to approach it. The hub area similar to Firelink Shrine or Majula in previous games will not be accessible at the beginning of the game, which means you will need to progress the game until you reach the hub area.\n\nAccording to Hidetaka Miyazaki: \"The Lands Between is supposed to invoke this feeling of something that's very mysterious and very ethereal \u2013 and we hope that when players play the game, they're going to experience that.\"\n\nIn the opening of the official reveal trailer that was presented in E3 2021,\u00a0we see a softly spoken, hooded woman saying \"The Tarnished, will soon return.\" The question is, who and what is The Tarnished? Simply put, you are the Tarnished. As the player, you are one of the Tarnished that have been exiled upon losing their blessing of Grace granted by the Elden Ring and the Erdtree, a tree that hosts source and life of The Lands Between. Very much like previous Souls games, where you are the Chosen Undead or the Ashen One. After the\u00a0shattering of the Elden Ring, you are then called back by this lost Grace to The Lands Between,\u00a0along with other Tarnished to recover the shards of the Elden Ring, to make them whole once again, and to become the Elden Lord of The Lands Between.\n\nAccording to Hidetaka Miyazaki in an interview: \" I feel like one of the main themes of the game is how the player, the Tarnished, approaches or treats this new-found grace and this return to the land that they were once banished from, how they interpret this and the meaning. It's not just the player-character, of course, it's lots of characters in the game, who are all beckoned back and will have their own adventures and motives. We want the player to discover for themselves what that means and how they want to begin their adventure.\"\n\nOne of the first\u00a0people the Tarnished encounters on their journey, Melina maintains an air of mystery throughout the game. She does not have a physical form and acts as the Tarnished's Finger Maiden in exchange for taking her to the Erdtree, then later on, to the Mountaintops of the Giants.\u00a0She approaches the Tarnished to aid her in her search for her purpose\u00a0given to her by her mother, who she believes can be found at the base of the Erdtree, leading many to speculate that her mother is Marika. When summoned, she wields the Blade of Calling, a dagger that was previously owned by the kindling maiden, fitting considering her role as kindling when the Erdtree is burnt down. Speaking with Melina at various Sites of Grace reveals\u00a0her ability to recall echoes of Queen Marika's past actions and words, which she offers in lieu of a \"maiden's guidance\".\n\nMelina holds contempt for the Frenzied Flame and believes that whoever lords over the chaos and damage it\u00a0brings\u00a0is no Lord at all. If the Tarnished takes the Frenzied Flame before the event at the Forge of the Giants, she will leave them and will threaten to deliver them Destined Death\u00a0once they become Lord of the Frenzied Flame.\n\nThe White Masks encountered in Mohgwyn Palace were initially abducted by Mogh, Lord of Blood and\u00a0turned into Bloody Fingers through an unknown ritual involving Mogh's accursed Omen blood. Of the four White Masks the Tarnished encounters in game, only Varre was able to withstand and tame the accursed blood. Despite being abducted by the Lord of Blood, he remains loyal\u00a0to the Mohgwyn Dynasty and tries to\u00a0indoctrinate the Tarnished into the dynasty. Even as he is dying at the at the end of his questline, forsaken by his Lord, he calls out to Mohg and blesses the Mohgwyn Dynasty.\n\nA\u00a0samurai\u00a0from the Land of Reeds whose purpose is\u00a0to hunt down Bloody Fingers. His biggest target is Eleonora, Violet Bloody Finger, a Tarnished whom he holds in high regard. It is uncertain what exactly caused Eleonora's corruption into a Bloody Finger - Yura himself warns the Tarnished against the dangers of Dragon Communion, stating that those who partake in it one day lose their humanity. On the other hand, other Bloody Fingers the Tarnished encounter, some of which are Yura's targets, are those that have been approached and swayed by Mohg, the Lord of Blood himself.\n\nA Tarnished that, despite his easy-going nature, is said to be a wise and powerful sorcerer by his old travelling companion, D. Rogier was once a scholar seeking the truth behind the Night of the Black Knives. His scholarly pursuits eventually brought him under Stormveil Castle, where he found and disturbed a corpse, causing him to be afflicted with Death. As opposed to D who sees Those Who Live in Death as a threat against the Golden Order, Rogier is empathetic towards them, believing them to have committed no offence. By finishing Rogier's quest, the Tarnished is able to help him reveal many insights about the night of the assassination before he finally succumbs to his affliction.\n\nA Tarnished Deathbed Companion driven from her home when awoken\u00a0by the guidance of grace. Fia describes a Deathbed Companion as a person who receives warmth and life from numerous champions, and then lays with the remains\u00a0of an exalted noble\u00a0to revive them, an act she says is revered in her homeland. She is empathetic towards Those Who Live in Death\u00a0and put it upon herself to be their guardian.\n\nBefore meeting her at Deeproot Depths, the Tarnished will encounter her champions - one of which is Rogier, and another who is Lionel the Lionhearted, a knight Fia met on her journey to the Lands Between who declared being her father. After bringing together Ranni's half of the Cursemark of Death from the Divine Tower of Liurnia and\u00a0Godwyn's half from D, she\u00a0implies that being Godwyn's Deathbed Companion will have him be reborn as a rune representing Those Who Live in Death\u00a0- the Mending Rune of the Death-Prince.\n\nA devout follower of the Golden Order, D\u00a0hunts Those Who Live in Death, most notably Tibia Mariners for their Deathroot.\u00a0He has a twin brother whose dialogue suggests his name is Darian. Despite having separate bodies and separate minds, the twins share the same soul and one cannot be\u00a0conscious when the other is. Where other\u00a0Orders would have seen them as cursed beings, the two twins found comfort in the Golden Order, the one Order that doesn't. D states that Those Who Live in Death go against the principles of the Golden Order,\u00a0and so they must be exterminated.\n\nD's Twin Brother, whose name is inferred to be Devin from D's voicelines. He can be found slumbering in the Siofra Aqueduct while D is alive, and\u00a0in the same place grieving when D is dead. Despite not being able to talk and interact with one another, the two brothers seem to be close\u00a0as he swears revenge against his brother's killer,\u00a0whether it be Fia or the Tarnished, when given his brother's armor set.\n\nA large beastman who hungers for Deathroot. Before meeting the Tarnished, D was\u00a0in charge of hunting for and providing Gurranq with these Deathroot. It is heavily implied that the Beast Clergyman the Tarnished encounters in Crumbling Farum Azula is Gurranq himself as he recognizes them if they have given him all 9 Deathroot.\u00a0It is therefore also implied that Gurranq is Maliketh, the Black Blade.\n\nMaliketh is Marika's Shadow\u00a0bestowed\u00a0upon her by the Greater Will as an Empyrean, like how Blaidd is to Ranni. According to the Stone of Gurranq, Maliketh\u00a0was a ferocious warrior whose name meant 'Death of the Demigods'. He was ordered by Marika to lock away the Rune of Death, also referred to as Destined Death. However, a fragment of the rune\u00a0was stolen and used in the Night of the Black Knives, leading to the death of the first demigod, Godwyn the Golden.\u00a0To ensure the rune was never stolen again, Maliketh bound his sword, imbued with the Rune of Death,\u00a0within his own body\u00a0and changed his name.\u00a0His Remembrance implies that he was betrayed by Marika, though in what exact matter is unknown.\n\nA Tarnished driven away from\u00a0her home across the sea. The cloak she wears implies that she used to be a member of royalty. At some point upon arriving at the Lands Between, she\u00a0happened upon\u00a0White Mask Varre, who gave her the same advice as he gives the Tarnished at the beginning of their journey - to seek Godrick and his Great Rune at Stormveil Castle. Upon arriving at Stormhill, the men escorting her were taken and sacrificed for grafting, leaving her in guilt\u00a0about the fact that she's too\u00a0afraid to join them.\n\nShe moves to the Roundtable Hold to find purpose after receiving the hopeful echoes of her men through the Chrysalids' Memento.\u00a0Here, Smithing Master Hewg\u00a0recognizes her potential for spirit tuning through her eyes, and with a bit of encouragement from the Tarnished, trains her to be a skillful spirit tuner. The two become close, and even as the Roundtable Hold is burning down, she stays behind with him to repay his kindness.\n\nA misbegotten chained and imprisoned\u00a0at the Roundtable Hold. Here, he is tasked by Queen Marika to smith a weapon strong enough to kill a god, a task that he makes his life goal. He will upgrade weapons and duplicate Ashes of War for the Tarnished. Hewg strongly believes the Tarnished will be the one to become Elden Lord, and will say so before he completely loses his memory.\n\nAdoptive daughter of Sir Gideon Ofnir. According to Gideon, he took her in when she lost the guidance of grace and became a Tarnished. Nepheli is a skilled warrior who believes in standing up and enacting justice for the weak and oppressed. She once believed that her adoptive father held the same beliefs, but after learning that he was the mastermind behind the attack on the Village of the Albinaurics, she loses faith in him.\u00a0It is speculated that Nepheli has ties with the first Elden Lord, Godfrey, and therefore the Golden Lineage, as she bears the same last name as Hoarah Loux and\u00a0as Kenneth Haight deems her worthy of taking up the mantle of leader of Limgrave.\n\nA member of the Erdtree royalty, self-proclaimed rightful leader of Limgrave and owner of Fort Haight. Kenneth looks down on Godrick and deems him unworthy of ruling Limgrave for his cowardly actions during the Shattering, as well as\u00a0not possessing the proper lineage required to rule.\u00a0After taking back Fort Haight from Godrick's forces and seeing the state it's been left in, Kenneth laments that he\u00a0doesn't have the authority to rule Limgrave and goes on to look for an eligible candidate, until he finally comes across Nepheli Loux.\n\nThe Gatekeeper of Stormveil Castle. Despite this, he informs the Tarnished of a safer side passage to allow them to enter the castle undetected. He can be caught sneaking and following the Tarnished around in the castle, and each time they are defeated, Gostoc steals a portion of the Golden Runes they drop. It seems he does this\u00a0with each Tarnished that comes to Stormveil Castle to challenge the shardbearer.\n\nGostoc holds contempt for the master of the castle, Godrick, having been mistreated and looked down upon by him. Much of Gostoc's dialogue reveals that he longs for freedom from his master and duties.\u00a0However, when Nepheli takes the throne, he is happy to return to his duties.\n\nA demi-human outcast often picked on for his looks. He\u00a0looks up\u00a0to his late mother, who was a skilled seamstress and one of few the few people who cared for him. Boc was kicked out of his former home in the Costal Cave and had his possessions stolen by the other demi-humans. After the Tarnished helps him take back his prized Sewing Needle and Tailoring Tools, he offers to tailor their armor as compensation.\n\nThroughout his interactions with the Tarnished, Boc expresses unhappiness towards his looks. The Tarnished can either grant Boc a Larval Tear to help change his appearance or let him know he's accepted by telling him he is beautiful, both of which though different in outcome,\u00a0Boc is grateful for.\n\nA cleric of the Golden Order. His armor implies that he once foretold an inauspicious prophecy, though of what exactly is unclear.\u00a0Throughout his questline, Corhyn\u00a0shows\u00a0high and unwavering faith in the Golden Order. He is greatly interested in\u00a0discovering the secrets of the Order, and so leaves the Roundtable in search for Goldmask, a great scholar of Golden Order fundamentalism.\n\nAfter introducing him to Goldmask,\u00a0Corhyn\u00a0acts as Goldmask's scribe, translating and recording his various finger movements into written records. Corhyn\u00a0holds Goldmask in high regard, but after learning of\u00a0his\u00a0reservations towards the Golden Order, Corhyn begins to question his master's intentions.\n\nThe ever brilliant Goldmask is a famed scholar of Golden Order fundamentalism\u00a0and\u00a0one of\u00a0many Tarnished called back to the Lands Between after the Shattering.\u00a0He doesn't speak and instead communicates through rhythmic hand and finger movements.\n\nGoldmask once lamented that hunters of Those Who Live in Death had been reduced to fanatics of the Golden Order and hunted simply for the sake of having an evil to fight against. Throughout his questline, the Tarnished aids\u00a0him in better understanding the Golden Order, most notably in the nature of Radagon, to correct the imperfections that lie within the Order. With the Mending Rune of Perfect Order, Goldmask concluded that the imperfections found were due to the very gods being\u00a0just as fickle\u00a0as ordinary men.\n\nA\u00a0Kindred of Rot disguised as an old sage\u00a0and\u00a0Millicent's\u00a0caretaker\u00a0as a child.\u00a0It is uncertain what or where his real form is as he returns to his shack as he was before most times after being attacked.\n\nAfter Malenia's Scarlet Aeonia bloomed in Caelid during the Shattering, Gowry dedicated his services to her, believing her to be the one to bring about a new order - the Order of Rot. In the swamp of Aeonia, he found Millicent, and presumably her sisters, as babies and proceeded to raise them, hoping that when Malenia one day ascended to be the Goddess of Rot, they too would be reborn as scarlet valkyries.\u00a0Of all the sisters,\u00a0Gowry saw the most potential in Millicent to follow in Malenia's footsteps.\n\nAt the end of Millicent's quest, Gowry asks\u00a0the Tarnished to aid Millicent's sisters in attacking her.\u00a0He believes that the betrayal she feels from the person she trusted the most will act as a catalyst\u00a0for her to 'bloom'.\n\nA\u00a0daughter of Malenia, Millicent shares many striking similarities with her mother - bright red hair, a missing arm from her severe scarlet rot affliction, and skilled swordsmanship that resembles her mother's style. Due to the scarlet rot, though she feels a sense of familiarity within Gowry's Shack, Millicent does not remember her childhood with Gowry.\n\nUpon being cured using the Unalloyed Golden Needle, Millicent sets out on a journey to seek Malenia. She hopes that she may be able to aid Malenia in resisting the call of the scarlet rot. Before she's able to reach the Empyrean, she is ambushed by her sisters at Elphael and possibly the Tarnished if they so choose. If the Tarnished defends her instead, Millicent reveals that she is aware of what Gowry hoped\u00a0to she would bloom into. She\u00a0removes the golden needle\u00a0and\u00a0succumbs\u00a0to the scarlet rot, not wanting\u00a0live as someone other than herself.\n\nThe blind daughter of Edgar, the Commander of Castle Morne. The Tarnished meets her after crossing the Bridge of Sacrifice to the Weeping Peninsula. With the help of her father and some attendants at the castle, she escaped Castle Morne after the Misbegotten serving under the castle rebelled. She cares much for her father and implores the Tarnished to deliver a letter persuading him\u00a0to leave the castle.\n\nTheir reunion unfortunately never happens as she gets murdered. From the large sword left by her corpse, it is implied that an escaped Misbegotten from Castle Morne was her killer.\n\nThe Commander of Castle Morne, ordained by Godrick. He has a high sense of duty\u00a0and stays behind to protect the castle's prized sword, the Grafted Blade Greatsword, even\u00a0after the rest of the castle's attendants had fled from the Misbegotten rebellion.\u00a0After finding Irina's body, he expresses regret over not protecting\u00a0her and swears vengeance towards her killers.\n\nEdgar can later be found at Revengers Shack as an invader. From the Shabriri Grape he drops, it is speculated that he succumbed to madness from Irina's death.\n\nA blind young woman who resembles Irina. Despite being blind, Hyetta is able to perceive some form of light every time she consumes a Shabriri Grape. While at first she is disgusted by the fact the Shabriri Grapes are human eyes, she quickly\u00a0comes to terms with it and affirms that it's required for her to become a finger maiden.\u00a0It seems that the Tarnished is not the only person bringing her Shabriri Grapes.\u00a0Hyetta mentions that other beings with trembling hands and emaciated fingers have given her the grapes before.\n\nSuccessfully completing her quest and aiding her in becoming a Finger Maiden gives the Tarnished more information on the Three Fingers and the Frenzied Flame.\n\nA mysterious figure who refers to himself as chaos incarnate. Shabriri inhabits Yura's body, who he claims willingly gave his body away. When the Tarnished meets him at the Mountaintops of the Giants, he tries to persuade them into becoming the Lord of Frenzied Flame and gives them information on the Frenzied Flame Proscription.\n\nShabriri was also the name of a man who previously had his eyes gouged out as punishment for his crime of slander. In time, his eyes were filled with the flame of frenzy. This, according to the Howl of Shabriri, was the first instance of the maddening sickness of frenzy in the Lands Between.\n\nThe daughter of Rennala and Radagon. She took after her mother and discovered her own full moon - Ranni's Dark Moon - and learnt cold sorceries from the mysterious Snow Witch she encountered deep in the woods. It seems that since childhood, she's held Blaidd and Iji dearly. At some point, Ranni\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Glintstone Dragon, Adula, who then swore their allegiance to her.\n\nAlthough she wasn't born a demigod, Radagon's unity with\u00a0Marika made her eligible to be an Empyrean.\u00a0Despite this, Ranni did not want to be controlled by the Two Fingers and rejected her fate. In an act of rebellion, Ranni masterminded the Night of the Black Knives, stealing the Rune of Death and imbuing its power in the knives of the Black Knife Assassins. On the\u00a0night of the assassination,\u00a0Ranni's body died and her soul\u00a0was transferred into\u00a0a doll reminiscent of her old teacher, Renna, the Snow Witch.\n\nThe half-wolven Shadow of Ranni, granted to her by the\u00a0Two Fingers when she became an Empyrean. Despite being\u00a0an agent of the Two Fingers, his loyalties lie only with Ranni, who he considers as family.\u00a0The sword he carries, the Royal Greatsword, was imbued with cold magic as proof of his loyalty.\n\nIf\u00a0an Empyrean\u00a0were to go against the will of the Two Fingers, their Shadow would go mad and\u00a0oppose them. Though this was the fate he would eventually\u00a0face, even in madness, Blaidd continued to defy his fate and remain faithful to Ranni.\n\nThe only friendly Troll the Tarnished encounters on their journey. Iji has two roles within the Carian royal family.\u00a0He is the royal family's\u00a0blacksmith.\u00a0According to Jerren, the blades smithed by Iji were blunt, but were able to resist decay when faced against scarlet rot.\n\nIji also acts as\u00a0Ranni's war counselor, providing her and those under her with guidance on the lost city of Nokron. He cares very much for both Blaidd and Ranni and has watched over them since they were children. Despite being loyal towards Ranni, Iji's Mirrorhelm seems to imply that he feared the consequence of his treachery against the Greater Will.\n\nA magic preceptor in service to the Carian Royal family, currently aiding Ranni in her search for the dark path. Seluvis helped Sellen in some way when she was initially exiled from the academy,\u00a0though she doesn't seem too fond of him when brought up.\n\nThough\u00a0prickly at first, if the Tarnished discovers his puppet collection and aids him in adding to it, he reveals his scheme to betray Ranni and add her, a demigod, to his collection. It is speculated that Seluvis and Pidia have a connection due to both their affinities towards puppets.\n\nOne of the numerous nomadic merchants the Tarnished can buy wares off of. He is acquainted with Blaidd, who refers to him as a busybody. The nomads used to prosper\u00a0as a group known as the Great Caravan. They were however accused of\u00a0heresy\u00a0and were cast deep underground to be buried alive. There, they summoned the flame of frenzy. Kale describes the nomadic clan as spiteful, and so it is presumed that their summoning ritual was done out of spite. The note on the Lord of Frenzied Flame implies that the nomads came to worship the frenzied flame.\n\nThis is further substantiated by pieces of Kale's cut quest that community members have been able to find. In this piece of cut content, the Tarnished would have\u00a0aided Kale in\u00a0discovering what happened to the Great Caravan. This would\u00a0have led them to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds, more specifically to the Frenzied Flame Proscription. He would comment on the bodies of the nomad clan found on the way to the\u00a0underground area - 'sick', 'maddened', 'husks of themselves', 'hardly human anymore'. He\u00a0finds out that his people were falsely accused of\u00a0worshipping the Three Fingers and\u00a0summoning the frenzied flame into the Lands Between. This fills him with spite towards the Greater Will and the Golden Order. He would have refused further trade with the Tarnished until they inherited the frenzied flame, after which he too would try to be granted an audience with the Three Fingers.\n\nInitially a nomadic wanderer, Jerren happened upon being a guest to the Carian royal family. During his time with the royal family, he\u00a0was able to get acquainted with it's various members, notably Ranni,\u00a0Iji, and Radahn. With the former two, he made a promise to slay a longstanding enemy of the Carian family, the Graven Witch Sellen, who had committed atrocities against many of her fellow sorcerers.\n\nBefore he got to fulfill that promise, General Radahn recruited him into his army as a guest commander during the Shattering. He is an excellent swordsman\u00a0and the Flamberge he wields is one of the symbols of Redmane Castle. When the Tarnished first meets him, he heralds the beginning of the war festival.\n\nSellen\u00a0was said to\u00a0be one of the most promising sorcerers in the history of the Raya Lucaria Academy. Scholars whose studies were deemed worthy received a glintstone crown, with Sellen having\u00a0a unique one from other scholars the Tarnished encounters at the academy. However, she was exiled from the academy for her obsession and forbidden pursuit of the primeval current.\n\nWhile not specified in-game, there are two speculated reasons that pursuing the primeval current is prohibited at the academy. One being the dangers it brought to the sorcerer pursuing it. During her quest, Sellen mentions two other primeval sorcerers, Master Lusat and Master Azur, both of which were masters of glintstone sorcery banished from the academy. Based on the sorceries each of them gives the player, their minds were broken simply by taking a glimpse into the primeval current.\n\nIt is also speculated that it is forbidden\u00a0due to requiring\u00a0human sacrifices. According to Jerren, Sellen has killed many of her fellow sorcerers in her studies. The Graven-School Talisman notes that fashioning the bodies of sorcerers into 'seeds of stars' is one method of pursing the primeval current.\n\nBecause of her scholarly pursuits, Sellen was imprisoned in Witchbane Ruins by the academy and the Carian Royal Family. If the Tarnished chooses to aid in her quest however,\u00a0they can help her inhabit a new unshackled body by transplanting her primeval glintstone, which is essentially her soul, into another compatible body.\n\nA glintstone sorcerer from the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Thops was looked down upon by his fellow scholars and nicknamed Thops the Bluntstone for not having\u00a0enough talent to cast\u00a0powerful sorceries. Despite this animosity, he longs to return to the academy to finish his\u00a0studies.\n\nIf the Tarnished chooses to aid him in his quest, he is able to complete his lifelong project. He creates the spell Thops's Barrier - a uniquely defensive glintstone sorcery able to deflect both sorceries and incantations back at its caster, a spell that is worthy of its own conspectus.\n\nA large turtle\u00a0and\u00a0steward of the Church of Vows. Miriel is a peaceful soul who teaches the Tarnished about Absolution, though he himself does not require it if they attack him.\u00a0He is well-versed in the history of Rennala and Radagon's union and is able to teach the Tarnished all manner of sorceries and incantations.\u00a0As opposed to Corhyn who deems incantations not related to the Golden Order as heresy, Miriel is open-minded towards each of the sorcery and incantation scrolls\u00a0the Tarnished gives him.\n\nA first generation Albinauric. The first generation of Albinaurics were created with defects in their legs, causing them to not be able to walk. According to Albus, when their legs fade, so too will their life.\n\nThe Tarnished finds him disguised as a pot to escape from Gideon's subordinates attacking the Village of the Albinaurics. He safeguards the right half of the Haligtree Secret Medallion, a medallion that is said to be key to reaching the promised land of the Albinaurics - Miquella's Haligtree.\n\nA first-generation Albinauric and\u00a0one of many wolf-riding Albinauric archers. She was interrogated by an agent of Sir Gideon Ofnir (or possibly the man himself) about the second half of the Haligtree Secret Medallion, leading to the death of her faithful wolf, Lobo.\n\nIf the Tarnished approaches her with the right half of the medallion,\u00a0Latenna asks them to take her to Apostate Derelict in exchange for the whereabouts of the left half of the secret medallion. Upon arriving at their destination, Latenna transfers a birthing droplet to a large Albinauric called Phillia. While it is unclear what exact purpose the droplet has, Latenna\u00a0mentions that is has something to do with creating life for the Albinaurics.\n\nSir Gideon Ofnir's silent right-hand man. The nature of his existence is obscure, however, his armor set, the Royal Remains Set, and weapon, the Clinging Bone, seem to suggest that Ensha is the reanimated remains of a king referred to as the Soulless King.\n\nFrom Gideon's dialogue, it is speculated that Ensha was tasked with finding both halves of the Haligtree Secret Medallion and that he attacks the Tarnished at the Roundtable Hold to take the half that they have found.\n\nConsort to Lord Rykard and adoptive mother of Rya. Tanith\u00a0worked as a dancer in an unnamed foreign land until she\u00a0caught Rykard's eye and became his consort. When he swore himself to blasphemy and became one with the God-Devouring Serpent, even after his\u00a0men turned against him, even after she was given the Tonic of Forgetfulness as an out, she continued to stayed by his side.\n\nNow, she is the Lady of the Volcano Manor, recruiting Tarnished who\u00a0were willing to rise against the Greater Will and become recusants. Those who proved themselves worthy were granted an audience by the Lord, where they were devoured and became part of the Volcano Manor family.\n\nThe\u00a0Tarnished can first meet this Ash of War teacher in Stormhill. Bernahl was said to be a Tarnished worthy of becoming Elden Lord, carrying out his destined path without doubt, until his maiden threw herself into 'the fire'. There are a few speculations as to what this might mean, with some speculating her\u00a0to have succumbed to the flame of frenzy, and others speculating that similar to Melina, she was thrown into the Forge of the Giants as kindling for burning the Erdtree.\n\nThe Tarnished can later find him as a recusant at the Volcano Manor. After defeating Rykard,\u00a0Bernahl denounces the Greater Will and vows to fell them on behalf of his brother.\n\nRya, whose\u00a0real name is Zorayas, is a\u00a0Man-Serpent disguised as a human\u00a0and the scout for the Volcano Manor.\u00a0Only the Tarnished and her adoptive mother, Tanith, knows of her true form. She holds great regard for Tanith, and strongly believes in her work and the endeavors of the Volcano Manor.\n\nHer quest involves her finding the truth behind her origins. She was told by Tanith that she was born by the grace of a great king. However, she notices that the Volcano Manor isn't all that it seems and eventually confronts Tanith about the secrets of the manor and other\u00a0secrets she's been keeping from her. The talisman she leaves behind at the end of her quest seems to suggest her mother was Daedicar, a woman who was said to have birthed multiple\u00a0grotesque children as a result of committing countless acts of adultery.\n\nPatches the Untethered is a bandit\u00a0who\u00a0tricks unsuspecting people into various death traps and entrapment schemes. If the Tarnished spares him, he will sell them various goods that he presumably from the corpses of those he successfully tricked. He mentions that his band of bandits comprise of foot soldiers and survivors of defeated armies\u00a0who were left to fend for themselves.\n\nPatches' Emporium can be accessed when reaching Volcano Manor. It seems that he has taken a liking to Tanith, who he\u00a0endangers himself\u00a0to\u00a0obtain the Dancer's Castanets for, an item he hopes will put her back to her right mind after Rykard's defeat.\n\nThe youngest son of House Hoslow, Diallos lives in the shadow of his elder brother, Juno Hoslow. As opposed to Juno who\u00a0is a formidable fighter, Diallos was all bark but no bite, unbefitting for a family whose motto revolves around bloodshed. Despite this, the two brothers\u00a0care for each other very much, with\u00a0Juno using his position to dote on Diallos, and with Diallos looking up to Juno as a role model.\n\nDiallos hopes to become a champion in similar fashion to his brother, but later becomes disillusioned with himself and seeks out another purpose in life.\n\nA young jar living in Jarburg, a secret village of peaceful\u00a0Living Jars. Jar-Bairn is one\u00a0of the few living Jars capable of speaking to the Tarnished and is a warrior jar like his uncle Alexander. The Tarnished may find Jar-Bairn talking in his sleep, where he dreams about reuniting with Alexander and telling him he's a warrior jar too, poachers destroying the Living Pots at Jarburg, or later Diallos\u00a0taking care of him.\n\nLiving Jar Shards contain traces of magical power and therefore fetch a high price, leading to Living Jars being a prize target for poachers. The only known item crafted with these shards is the Ironjar Aromatic, a forbidden defense-boosting consumable created by Depraved Perfumers.\n\nAn older Living Jar that left his home of Jarburg to seek great battle and hone his combat skills. Alexander is a warrior jar,\u00a0Living Jars filled with the remains of warriors.\u00a0According to him and Jar-Bairn, warrior jars are destined to leave their home and set out on journeys alone to become great champions. Though not explicitly explained, it seems as though warrior jars are able to absorb the\u00a0essence of the\u00a0fallen warriors they consume and\u00a0by doing so, can also pick up some of their martial prowess.\n\nA Tarnished and former criminal\u00a0selling boiled prawns and crabs at the Boilprawn Shack, and later just outside the royal capital. It is possible that\u00a0Boggart was previously convicted for thievery, as he'd stolen Rya's necklace when\u00a0the Tarnished meets him. He\u00a0used to be cellmates with Dung Eater, where he witnessed\u00a0the latter defile the body of his friend with the Seedbed Curse.\u00a0It\u00a0was the most harrowing experience Boggart had ever had.\n\nA Tarnished who, as his armor suggests, bears the heart of an Omen. Even before being brought back to the Lands Between, the Dung Eater was a merciless killer. He would defile the corpses of those he killed with Seedbed Curses and curse their soul to never be able to return to the Erdtree. His biggest aspiration is to defile and curse not only everyone in the Lands Between,\u00a0but all future generations, a dream that can be realized by aiding him in gestating the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse.\n\nA Finger Reader Crone the Tarnished encounters at the Roundtable Hold. The finger readers are interpreters for the Two Fingers,\u00a0sharing the wisdom\u00a0of the Greater Will to the inhabitants of the Lands Between.\u00a0With the exception of Enia, the finger readers the Tarnished encounters seem to be frantic from the loss of their Two Fingers. Despite being an agent of the Greater Will, she is supportive of you burning down the Erdtree when her Two Fingers stop communicating with her.\n\nShe claims that before the Tarnished, another had gathered 2 Great Runes. It is speculated that this person is either Bernahl, whose armor suggest that he was worthy of becoming a Lord, or Vyke, who was said to be the closest who ever got to becoming Elden Lord before he suddenly sought out the Frenzied Flame.\n\nQueen Marika, the Eternal is a Numen chosen and brought from her homeland to the Lands Between by the Greater Will to be their\u00a0vassal. As an Empyrean, she was gifted Maliketh as a Shadow and half-brother, whom she entrusted the Rune of Death to when the Golden Order was established. She had two consorts during her reign, the first being Godfrey. They had three children together, Godwyn the Golden, and the Omen twins, Morgott and Mohg.\n\nTo spread the influence of the Golden Order, Marika and her followers, on behalf of the Greater Will, waged wars against several factions and gods in the lands between, the most notable ones being the Storm Lord, the fire giants and their god, the One-Eyed God, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian royal family. While it is unclear which side instigated the war, there were also wars against the Dragons and the Godskin Apostles and their god, the Gloam-Eyed Queen.\n\nThough the\u00a0war against the Giants ended in their favor, Marika realized that she would be unable to extinguish the flame at the Forge of the Giants, the fabled 'flame of ruin' strong enough to burn the Erdtree, and thus cursed the final Fire Giant survivor to protect the forge for all eternity. When the last war was finally over, Marika took the\u00a0the blessing of grace from Godfrey and his warriors, turning them into Tarnished, and exiled them from the Lands Between. It was then that she took Radagon to be her second consort, and had the twins Miquella and Malenia.\n\nAt some point, Marika started to harbor doubts towards the Greater Will and the Golden Order. It is speculated that she had a hand in the Night of the Black Knives due to her rumored connection with the Black Knife Assassins. Marika's final act of rebellion against the Greater Will was the shattering of the Elden Ring, an act that caused her imprisonment within the Erdtree and the war between the demigods.\n\nRadagon, characterized by his flowing red locks, is Queen Marika's second chosen consort and a great warrior. His\u00a0early life and how he came to be\u00a0a prominent figure in the Golden Order\u00a0remain a mystery. There is speculation that he may be a smaller-sized Fire Giant from the descriptions of the Sword of Milos and Giant's Red Braid. Another running theory is that he was cursed to have red hair by the Fire Giants as a result\u00a0of the Golden Order's war with them. Either way, Radagon was said to have hated the red-tint of his hair.\n\nIn the war against Liurnia of the Lakes and it's inhabitants, he was tasked by Marika to lead the Erdtree's armies. The sword monuments the Tarnished can find in Liurnia suggest that there were two Liurnian Wars, and that it was\u00a0after the second\u00a0war that Radagon and Rennala fell in love. Radagon sought absolution at the Church of Vows using Celestial Dew, and the two were bonded by marriage, uniting the Capital of Leyndell and Academy of Raya Lucaria. The Glintstone Kris is one of the symbols of the unity of the two factions.\n\nAs is tradition, Rennala bestowed a Moon Greatsword onto Radagon, her spouse. They bore 3 children - General Radahn, Praetor Rykard, and Lunar Princess Ranni. However, much to Rennala's dismay, Radagon gifted her an Amber Egg and left her to join Marika's side when Godfrey and his fellow Tarnished were exiled from the Lands Between. They\u00a0had the twin demigods, Miquella and Malenia, and he reforged his Moon Greatsword into the Golden Order Greatsword.\u00a0 A speculated explanation for the requirement of both Faith and Intelligence in casting Golden Order Incantations is due to Radagon having learnt sorceries while Rennala's consort and incantations when consort to Queen Marika.\n\nIt is revealed by a statue in the Royal Capital that Marika and Radagon are one and the same. It is unlcear whether they were always one, whether Radagon is a fragment of Marika, or as Melina's dialogue suggests, that they became one after becoming consorts. Despite being one and the same person, Marika and Radagon held different wills and when Marika shattered the Elden Ring, he used the same hammer she used to try to repair it.\n\nThe first consort to Queen Marika and the first Elden Lord. They had 3 children together - Godwyn the Golden, and the Omen twins, Morgott and Mohg. Godfrey was originally know as Hoarah Loux, a fierce warrior with a strong bloodlust and the chieftain of the badlands. Upon being selected as Marika's first consort, he took Beast Regent Serosh upon his back to quell his insatiable bloodlust and be more befitting of a Lord.\n\nWhen the Golden Order was established, he was tasked with leading several wars to further the influence of the Order,\u00a0including one against the Giants, as well as the Storm Lord, who he faced alone. It also seemed that during his reign, gladitorial combat in colosseums all over the Lands Between were commonplace as rituals held to honor the Erdtree. This practice died out when Radagon became Marika's next consort.\n\nAfter Godfrey won his last campaign and there were no worthy opponents left to battle with, Marika took away the Erdtree's blessing from him and countless others, turning them into Tarnished, whom\u00a0he led out of the Lands Between\u00a0in a journey referred to as the Long March. His axe was broken in a battle during this time\u00a0and after\u00a0the journey ended, he reverted back to becoming a simple warrior, though still carrying Serosh on his back.\n\nAs a young astrologer, Rennala would always gaze up at the stars. After\u00a0a chance encounter\u00a0with the Full Moon, she learnt of its magic and became one of the most powerful glintstone sorcerers.\u00a0Her new mastery over lunar magic\u00a0bewitched the Academy of Raya Lucaria,\u00a0allowing her to become head of the academy and the Glintstone Knights, as well as establish the Carian family as royalty.\n\nDuring the Second Liurnian War, where\u00a0the Golden Order waged territorial war against the Academy, Rennala met and fought against one of the Erdtree's champions, Radagon, where they fell in love and reconciled at the Church of Vows. As is tradition, Rennala bestowed upon\u00a0her consort\u00a0a Moon Greatsword, which was later reforged into the Golden Order Greatsword. Their\u00a0union bore three children, Lunar Princess Ranni, General Radahn, and Praetor Rykard. One night, Rennala took Ranni out stargazing as she did in her childhood. This is what\u00a0led to Ranni meeting\u00a0her own moon, the Dark Moon.\n\nWhen Godfrey was exiled from the Lands Between and Radagon returned to Marika's side, Rennala was devastated and grew weak. Her charm over the Academy fell as well, and\u00a0its scholars rebelled against the Carian royal family,\u00a0with the Cuckoo Knights launching an attack against Caria Manor and\u00a0Rennala ending up being locked up in the Grand Library, where the Tarnished finds her cradling the Amber Egg given to her by Radagon as a parting gift.\n\nMorgott is one of two Omen twins born of Queen Marika and Godfrey. The horns of an Omen were signifiers of the divine in the ages before the Erdtree, however after the establishment of the Golden Order, Omen were\u00a0thought to be cursed beings without the guidance\u00a0of grace. They had their horns cut off and were subject to slavery, but those born with royal blood were instead hidden from the world and shackled deep underneath Leyndell in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds.\n\nDespite being locked away and shunned, Morgott still loved the Order. During the Shattering, Leyndell was leaderless and defenseless. Knowing that Leyndell wouldn't accept an Omen as a leader, Morgott\u00a0ruled the capital in the shadows as the Unveiled Monarch. During the Second Defense of Leyndell, he successfully defended the capital and the Erdtree from his fellow invading demigods. His dialogue suggests he attempted to claim the throne of the Elden Lord, but the Erdtree warded him off.\n\nThe Tarnished will first encounter Morgott under\u00a0the pseudonym, Margit, preventing them from challenging Godrick in Stormveil Castle and obtaining one of many Great Runes required to enter the capital.\n\nSon of Queen Marika\u00a0and her first consort, Godfrey. Unlike his twin brother who\u00a0distanced himself from his Omen nature,\u00a0Mohg fully embraced his accursed Omen blood and traits. Like his brother, he was shackled deep within the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds. While imprisoned underground,\u00a0he encountered the Formless Mother, an outer god like the Greater Will. This encounter caused his accursed omen blood to ignite, and gave him the ability to cast bloodflame incantations. Mohg\u00a0used his spear, Mohgwyn's Sacred Spear, to further communicate with the Formless Mother.\n\nAt some point he managed to escape from the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds, and established the Mohgwyn Palace in a\u00a0secluded part of the Siofra River. He recruited multiple people to become followers of the upcoming Mohgwyn Dynasty, offering deals to some, like Bloody Finger Okina,\u00a0and kidnapping others, like the War Surgeons.\n\nWhile he is not an Empyrean himself and thus unable to ascend to godhood, he hoped to claim the title of\u00a0monarch by raising empyrean Miquella to full godhood and becoming his consort. Mohg stole the slumbering Miquella from inside the Haligtree and attempted to rouse him with his accursed blood. However, no matter how much blood he offered and how\u00a0much he shared his bedchambers with the empyrean, Miquella never\u00a0woke from his slumber.\n\nPraetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor and a ruthless justiciar. He is the son of Rennala\u00a0and Radagon and like his siblings, became a demigod after Radagon's unity with Queen Marika. Rykard presides over Mt. Gelmir and was served by the Gelmir Knights. The lava sorceries\u00a0the Tarnished can learn were created by Rykard, with some\u00a0being old hexes from Mt. Gelmir that\u00a0he\u00a0turned into practical sorceries. At some point, Rykard met Tanith in a foreign land and brought her back to the Lands Between to be his consort.\n\nRykard had a hand in the Night of the Black Knives, though to what extent is unclear. The Blasphemous Claw was an item rewarded by his sister Ranni allowing him to challenge Maliketh as a last resort. The description for the Taker's Cameo implies that Rykard believed that Marika and her Order ruled by force, and so he swore himself to blasphemy and\u00a0sought to overthrow them, an ambition that drew many towards him.\n\nThe\u00a0ancient\u00a0people of Mt. Gelmir\u00a0worshipped a powerful serpent god that they would offer up sacrifices to. Rykard one day encountered the God-Devouring Serpent and offered himself and his Great Rune\u00a0up as sacrifices\u00a0to grant himself immortality, allowing him to grow and devour people and gods alike for all eternity. This fall\u00a0into greed and\u00a0glutinous depravity caused most of his followers to turn against him, with Tanith being a notable exception. Those who were once Gelmir Knights sought out the Serpent-Hunter, a great spear designed to hunt the immortal serpent, to put an end to their Lord. They found the mythical weapon, but were unsuccessful in defeating Rykard, as evident from the corpses holding the Serpent-Hunter in his boss room.\n\nWhen the Tarnished visits the Volcano Manor, they can find it's members following Rykard's blasphemous path. It is later revealed that those who proved themselves as recusants were granted an audience with Rykard and became part of the family - that is by being devoured by the great serpent himself.\n\nThe remaining members of this faction are Rennala, Ranni, and their trusted advisors. Though they once held power over the Academy of Raya Lucaria, Rennala's grief over Radagon's departure caused her to weaken and the academy's scholars to rebel.\n\nNow, serving the royal family means serving the last Carian princess, Ranni, in her mission to usurp the Two Fingers and Greater Will, and rebel against her fate as an Empyrean.\n\nThis section is dedicated to speculative and theoretical content created by the Elden Ring community. The information therein may be based on in-game fact and real world myths, but all theory pieces are simply the interpretation of the user(s) that wrote them and not canon.\n\nSome of the main questions posed by the lore of the Lands Between:\n\nHere is a list of possible attempts to overthrow the Greater Will. Note that for the most part all of these are merely plausible theories and may\u00a0or may not be proven in the future.\n\nHewg the Blacksmith was assigned by Queen Marika to create a weapon that could slay \"God\" but was not able to do so in time:\"Queen Marika, please forgive me, I haven't made a weapon that could kill God yet\" - Hewg the Blacksmith\n\nNokron the Eternal City succeeded in creating the above mentioned weapon but was immediately accused of treason, resulting in its destruction and banishing below the earth.\n\nMarika \"created\" Melina\u00a0and gave her the mission to burn down the Erdtree. Melina wandered around the Lands Between in search for her purpose.Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago, for the reason that I yet live, burned and bodyless.\" - Melina\n\nThe Shattering of the Ring: It is suspected that Marika did not destroy the Elden Ring out of rage over Godwyn's death. It is possible that his death\u00a0merely awakened her,\u00a0barely giving back enough sanity\u00a0to destroy the Elden Ring in\u00a0an attempt to find the strongest of the champions for them to claim the power of the Great Runes and become Elden Lord (or at least\u00a0free her from her suffering). The war however, did not conclude in a winner as Radahn and Malenia\u00a0proofed to be equal in strength.\n\nMarika used the last shimmer of grace to invite even the Tarnished to fight for the Great Runes and become Elden Lord, even granting them revival upon death. Radagon\u00a0is trying to hinder this plan by blocking the Tarnished with the roots of the Erdtree. Whether this plan succeeds is up to the player to find out.",

    "score": 999,
    "subreddit": "Fextralife Wiki",
    "body": "The Outer Gods are mysterious beings mentioned throughout the lore of Elden Ring. They do not appear to manifest physical forms within the Lands Between and instead influence the events of the Lands Between in other ways, including through worship by denizens of the Lands Between and by powering incantations.\n\nThe Outer Gods are responsible for many of the events that happen both before and during Elden Ring's story, and have acted in both benevolent and malicious ways.\n\nThis is a list of Outer Gods whose status is confirmed explicitly by in-game descriptions.\n\nAn Outer God also known as the \"Mother of Truth\" who craves wounds. The Formless Mother\u00a0is associated most closely with Mohg, Lord of Blood, giving him and his followers access to\u00a0Blood Oath Incantations. When Mohg\u00a0stood before her,\u00a0deep underground, his accursed blood erupted with fire. Mohg's attempts to elevate his brother Miquella to Godhood imply that the Formless Mother possesses the ability to uplift someone to the status of a god. In the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, the mother of truth is described as the savior of the Bloodfiends\u00a0who engage in similar rituals to the Mohgwyn Dynasty.\n\nReference to the Formless Mother being an Outer God can be found in the description of\u00a0Mohgwyn's Sacred Spear.\n\nAn Outer God associated with the corrupting Scarlet Rot. Sage Gowry, who proclaims himself dedicated to the \"Order of Rot\" likens said order to \"the cycle of decay and rebirth\".\u00a0The Kindred of Rot are the servants of the Goddess of Rot, and are servants that have been forsaken. Other pests such as ants and scorpions have a connection to rot.\n\nAccording to the Blue Dancer Charm, this Outer God was reportedly sealed away by a blind swordsman with a flowing sword, and the Lake of Rot Map confirms that the lake of rot is the location of this sealing. The Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom implies that this same swordsman goes on to mentor Malenia, who is similarly afflicted with rot. Malenia's elevation to the Goddess of Rot maintains a pattern of people being uplifted to the status of God while also being associated with a higher being or Outer God. In the land of shadow,\u00a0Romina, Saint of the Bud\u00a0discovered a twisted divine element, which she weaved into the baleful scarlet rot.\u00a0According to the Hefty Rot Pot, rot is one of the divine elements of the Outer Gods, and eats away at life like a vicious plague. This is reflected in Millicent's questline and Malenia's ultimate fate.\n\nReference to the God of Rot being an Outer God can be found in the descriptions of the Lake of Rot Map and the Scorpion's Stinger.\n\nAn Outer God related in some fashion to death and the undead. All that is stated about this Outer God is that the Twinbird is its vassal, and that the Twinbird is in turn the mother of Deathbirds. In the time when there was no Erdtree, death was burned in ghostflame. Deathbirds were the keepers of that fire.\n\nIn times of old, the dead were burned with ghostflame, and from those cinders arose vengeful spirits. Ghostflame sorceries such as Ancient Death Rancor and Explosive Ghostflame\u00a0are explicitly related to the Deathbirds. As these are death sorceries which are boosted by the Prince of Death's Staff, it may be reasonable to infer that the Deathbirds, and therefore their god, are similar in nature to Those Who Live in Death and are aligned with them in some way. Deathbirds also count as Those Who Live in Death as they possess the same weakness. This idea is strengthened by a ghostflame weapon, the Helphen's Steeple, which is dropped by a Tibia Mariner. According to the Steeple, there is a place known as the Helphen which may be associated with this outer god. \u00a0Priests would become guardians of the birds through the rite of Death, which also serves as an oath sworn to their distant resurrection.\u00a0Mausoleum Knights\u00a0evoke the Deathbirds with their armor and maintain a vigil after death over the Walking Mausoleums and the deceased demigod Godwyn the Golden in Deeproot Depths. Godwyn is\u00a0the Prince of Death, scion of the golden bough and First of the Dead among the demigods.\n\nReference to the God of the Twinbird being an Outer God can be found in the Twinbird Kite Shield's\u00a0description.\n\nAn\u00a0Outer God with an\u00a0association with the Fire Giants, Fire Prelates, Fire Monks, and the flame of ruin. In the land of shadow, there are verdigris items such as an armor set, a talisman, and a greatshield. Verdigris metal is said to be the gift of an Outer God. It is similar in appearance and hue to the large plate and adornments carried by the Fire Giant on the mountaintops. The giants were gifted smiths, and in ancient times, smithing was considered divine. Furthermore, like other Outer Gods, the Fell God let the Fire Giants borrow its power, but they were\u00a0in turn given a curse. The Fell God, according to the\u00a0One-Eyed Shield, was rumored to have been slain by Queen Marika but still lurks within the Fire Giants themselves according to the\u00a0Flame of the Fell God\u00a0spell description. Upon realizing the flames of their forge would never die, Queen Marika kept one of the Fire Giants alive. According to the\u00a0Furnace Visage, the\u00a0Furnace Golems\u00a0have\u00a0a\u00a0stone mask surrounded by curled horns, depicting the fell god of fire that haunts the sagas of the hornsent.\n\nReference to the Fell God of Fire being an Outer God can be found in the Verdigris Armor\u00a0description.\n\nThe Frenzied Flame is either an Outer God itself or a manifestation of an Outer God's influence.\u00a0 At the end of Hyetta's questline, she is able to speak to us on behalf of the Frenzied Flame's Three Fingers.\u00a0It outlines its beliefs that the Greater Will's act of \"fracturing\" the \"One Great\" into life as we know it was a mistake and is the source of all suffering. Its intentions are to burn the world, \"until all is One again\".\u00a0This Outer God\u00a0is\u00a0associated with the various Frenzied Flame Incantations\u00a0and can be sided with, culminating in the \"Lord of Frenzied Flame\" ending.\n\nThe Frenzied Flame is never specifically referenced as an Outer God but is subdued using Miquella's Needle\u00a0which states its specific function is to \"ward away the meddling of Outer Gods\". It may be argued that the Flame is the \"meddling\" and not the Outer God itself, but this does seem to confirm that there is an Outer God involved.\n\nTrident of Mohg, Lord of Blood. A sacred spear that will come to symbolize his dynasty. As well as serving as a weapon, it is an instrument of communion with an outer god who bestows power upon accursed blood.\n\nThe clan, who lost everything in the great fires, peered upon the corpse of their ancestor, normally an act of sanctity, and saw in its shadow a twisted deity. The clan had suffered such torment that the horrible thing was taken as an object of worship.\n\nAshen remains in which spirits yet dwell.\u00a0Use to summon the spirit of a bloodfiend hexer.\u00a0Summoning consumes HP rather than FP.\n\nThis spirit conducts bloodboon rituals with a sacred spear, casts bloodflame hexes, and takes a singular pleasure in letting the blood of foes.\n\nLong ago, a subjugated tribe discovered a twisted deity amongst the ravages of war, and they were transformed into bloodfiends. The mother of truth was their savior.\n\nA great lake of standing water downstream of the Ainsel River. It is said that the divine essence of an outer god is sealed away in this land.\n\nDagger fashioned from a great scorpion's tail, glistening with scarlet rot.\n\nA ceremonial tool used by heretics, crafted from the relic of a sealed outer god.\n\nCraftable item prepared using a capacious cracked pot.\u00a0A cocktail of rotten materials is sealed inside.\n\nThrow at enemies to cause a large buildup of scarlet rot.\n\nRot is one of the divine elements of the outer gods, and eats away at life like a vicious plague.\n\nShield featuring a vividly painted twinbird. The twinbird is said to be the envoy of an outer god, and mother of the Deathbirds.\n\nAt dwindling levels of HP, this shield slightly boosts both attack and defense.\n\nStrike the ground with the staff, triggering an explosion of ghostflame that burns the surrounding area.\n\nIn the time when there was no Erdtree, death was burned in ghostflame. Deathbirds were the keepers of that fire.\n\nA smaller imitation of the furnace golem's visage. Material used for crafting items.\n\nA stone mask surrounded by curled horns, depicting the fell god of fire that haunts the sagas of the hornsent.\n\nChest armor made from an unusual metal known as verdigris. Verdigris is said to be the gift of an outer god.\n\nPossessed of an enormously hefty yet supple strength thanks to its rusted nature.\n\nA great stone shield with an intricately carved fingerprint design.\n\nPart of the tomb of an ancient god, the Readerless Fingers relayed their message through these imprints, said to be the very seeds from which frenzy first sprouted.\n\nOne of the unalloyed gold needles that Miquella crafted to ward away the meddling of outer gods.\n\nCapable of subduing the flame of frenzy if inherited, allowing one to cheat fate and avoid becoming Lord of Frenzied Flame.\n\nHowever, the needle is as yet unfinished and can only be used in the heart of the storm beyond time said to be found in Farum\u00a0Azula.",

These deific figures descend from either Queen Marika the Eternal or her second Lord consort Radagon of the Golden Order. In the base game most of the Demigods\u00a0go on to claim Great Runes of the shattered Elden Ring and vie for power in a struggle known as the Shattering. The first of the Demigods would be the Golden Linage\u00a0descending from Queen Marika and Godfrey, First Elden Lord. Radagon would first wed Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon and together they have\u00a0Demigod children who\u00a0became prominent members of\u00a0the Carian Royal Family. This family would become fractured when Radagon leaves Rennala to become the second Elden Lord after Godfrey is divested of Grace. Radagon and Marika have Demigod children together who would also gain the title of Empyreans.\n\nMost of these Demigods will drop Remembrances when defeated, allowing the player to trade them in for spells, weapons, or items unique to the Demigods at the Roundtable Hold with Enia.\u00a0They can also be used to gain a significant amount of runes instead. Additionally\u00a0after their defeat some of the Demigods apparel will become available for purchase from Enia. Some apparel of the Demigods can be altered at sites of grace but requires the Golden Tailoring Tools\u00a0and Golden Sewing Needle from the Church of Vows in order to do so. Boc can also provide this service for free after\u00a0progressing his questline and after acquiring one of the applicable armor pieces. The applicable armor pieces\u00a0are;\u00a0Radahn's Lion Armor,\u00a0Lord of Blood's Robe, and\u00a0Messmer's Helm .\n\nBut should ye fail to become aught at all,ye will be forsaken.\n\nIt is said that this cyst came from the corrupted visage of one unable to die a true Death. Indeed, it comes from the Prince of Death, scion of the golden bough and First of the Dead among the demigods.\n\nThis golden battleaxe is emblazoned with the figure of a beast, representing the strength of Godfrey, First Elden Lord and patriarch of the golden lineage.\n\n\"I command thee kneel! For I am the lord of all that is golden!\"\n\nLegendary ashen remains.\u00a0Use to summon the spirit of Kristoff, the Ancient Dragon Knight.\n\nSpirit of Kristoff, an honorable knight of Leyndell who was also a devout worshipper of the ancient dragons.\u00a0His skills strike down foes with thunderbolts, the dragons' weapon of choice.\n\nAfter the First Defense of Leyndell, Kristoff earned the hero's honor of Erdtree Burial for the feat of capturing Godefroy the Grafted.\n\nDoll of a curseborn bairn from the Erdtree's royal line.\u00a0Uses FP to unleash many wraiths that chase down foes.\n\nOmen babies born of royalty do not have their horns excised, but instead are kept underground, unbeknownst to anyone, imprisoned for eternity.\n\nA fetish bathed in golden magic.\u00a0Shackles were used to bind the accursed people called the Omen,\u00a0and these ones were made to keep a particular Omen under\u00a0strictest confinement.\n\nThough faint, the shackles still retain vestiges of power \u2014 enough\u00a0to trap the once-bound Mohg on earth, if only for a short time.\n\nAshen remains in which spirits yet dwell.\u00a0Use to summon the spirit of a man-serpent.\n\nSpirit of a deformed man-serpent that wields a whip of magma.\n\nIt is said that long ago, the elder serpent that dwelled on Mt. Gelmir devoured a demigod, and the birth of the man-serpents followed.\n\nA talisman engraved with a scene from a heroic tale.\n\nThe mightiest hero of the demigods confronted the falling stars alone\u2014and thus did he crush them, his conquest sealing the very fate of the stars.\n\nCursemark carved into the discarded flesh of Ranni the Witch.\u00a0Also known as the half-wheel wound of the centipede.\n\nThis cursemark was carved at the moment of Death of the first demigod,\u00a0and should have taken the shape of a circle.\n\nHowever, two demigods perished at the same time,\u00a0breaking the cursemark into two half-wheels.\n\nRanni was the first of the demigods whose flesh perished,\u00a0while the Prince of Death perished in soul alone.\n\nOne of the incantations of the Golden Order fundamentalists. A gift of gratitude to the young Miquella from his father, Radagon.\n\nProduces a golden ring of light and fires it across a wide area. Charging enhances range.\n\nAnd yet, the young Miquella abandoned fundamentalism, for it could do nothing to treat Malenia's accursed rot. This was the beginning of unalloyed gold.\n\nWinged helm made of unalloyed gold.\u00a0Worn by Malenia, Blade of Miquella.\n\n\u201cMy brother will keep his promise. He possesses the wisdom, the allure, of a god \u2013 he is the most fearsome Empyrean of all.\u201d\n\nThe kindling that burned inside Messmer the Impaler.\u00a0A dark thing, eaten away at by a wicked serpent.\n\nBurns the sealing tree said to be found at the old Rauh ruins.\n\nMessmer, much like his younger sister, bore a vision of fire.\n\nA finely-made \"redshield\" featuring an engraving of a winged serpent. Excels at guarding against fire.\n\nSaid to have been made to commemorate the beginnings of the crusade started by\u00a0Messmer, son of Marika.\n\nMarika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring known as the Great Runes, and the mad taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering.\n\nYou wish to know more of Lord Radagon? Lord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks. He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle. He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen.However, when Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between, Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort, taking the title... of second Elden Lord. The mystery endures, to this day... As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside... and moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord.\n\nAhh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods: the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring. Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord. And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished.\n\n\"The Greater Will has long renounced the demigods. Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left.\" ...Indeed. But remember one thing. The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted.",

    "subreddit": "Fextralife Wiki",
    "body": "Radagon of the Golden Order is a Boss in Elden Ring. Radagon is a tall, fractured god wielding the hammer that shattered the Elden Ring, and is found in the heart of the Erdtree. He was previously married to Rennala, but became Queen Marika's consort after Godfrey was exiled from the Lands Between. Completing Brother Corhyn & Goldmask's\u00a0quest to a certain point reveals that he is the \"other half\" of Queen Marika. Despite being of one body, the two do not share the same will, as evident from Radagon attempting to repair the Elden Ring after Marika had shattered it. This boss is NOT optional as players must defeat him to reach\u00a0the end of Elden Ring's story.\n\nAs the husband of Rennala of Caria, the red-haired Radagon studied sorcery, and as the husband of Queen Marika, he studied incantations.\n\nRadagon of the Golden Order can be found by entering the glowing wall after defeating Hoarah Loux, Warrior. [Map Link]\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs. The values after the \"/\"s indicate the increased resistances after each successive proc.\n\nAt the start of the fight, you can run up to Radagon and safely land one or two attacks, depending on your weapon's speed.\n\nRadagon is vulnerable to stance damage, which can break his stance up to three times during the fight. This provides opportunities to reapply buffs, drink flasks, or deal more damage. Weapons with quick guard counters, like Dragon King's Cragblade, are effective here. Slower weapons, like Bloodhound's Fang, may struggle to capitalize on his openings. Most of his attacks have long recovery times, allowing you to use a jumping heavy attack or charged attack.\n\nUse Godskin magic, such as Black Flame Blade, since Godskin Apostle Incantations were designed to defeat gods like Radagon.\n\nThe primary melee threat is Radagon's grab. When his arm glows, he prepares a lunging grab with a generous hitbox and limited tracking. This move can kill from full health with 50 Vigor, even with Lionel's Set and damage reduction talismans. To avoid it, start sprinting as soon as he begins his grab, or roll into him to dodge reliably.\n\nRecommended talismans for melee users are Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Haligdrake Talisman, and Green Turtle Talisman. This setup will minimize chip damage from his attacks. Radagon\u2019s backswing can still hit you even if you roll past him, so maintain high HP and stamina to exploit his openings. The Crimson Seed Talisman will extend the effectiveness of each flask in this demanding final boss battle.\n\nAt the beginning of the fight, you can hit him with\u00a0two fast- or medium-casting spells (although sometimes he parries the second), or one slow-casting spell.\n\nWhen fighting Radagon at range, there are two major threats - maybe three. The first is his big ground slam. This is easily identified by him leaping into the air and hovering for a bit. Reflexes say dodge when this hits the ground but that is the last thing you want to do. It's not so much a typical AoE attack as it is a nova. So, the attack spreads out. You want to dodge after he hits. It might take a try or two to get this one figured out. The second major one is when he charges up his hammer and slams it three times in a row for big fan-shaped explosions. Much like the first, this one has some deceptiveness built in. It is not a 100% fan that hits everywhere it lights up. It actually fires out several trails, one of which goes right towards you. This becomes super easy to dodge once you realize this because all you need to do is dodge backward (or forward) at 45-60 degree angle and he'll miss with all of them.\n\nOne note about the first slam is that it might feel like a good time to get in some damage, and it is, but don't get caught with your pants down and in a big animation. Even if he looks like he might attack a spirit or friend, he has a tendency to change targets while up in the air and gives little warning!\n\nThe third major thing to watch out for is his lightning bolt. However, this one doesn't have much in the way of trickery, but getting the timing down might take a try or two.\n\nOnce you can reliably avoid these three things the rest of it is pretty easy in terms of defense. The biggest trouble is finding the time to get the hits in. Something with a quick animation is your friend, but he is also prone to losing/switching aggro so you can hit him with something big here and there. He also seems to maintain a fairly steady tempo, so his wind-up/wind-down/recovery between attacks feels consistent and can help you get an idea for when to attack.\n\nAs for what he is weak to? Good question! Testing would be required, but he seems to take a lot of damage from most things. Glintstone Icecrag hits him really hard, and Stars of Ruin can do some work if you need a bit more range. Hitting him with Ranni's Dark Moon when he loses aggro can give you a little boost in damage going forward thanks to its magic resistance reduction. Quite frankly, he takes a lot of damage and could even be considered fairly squishy, but he has a tendency to take you out of the fight before you can capitulate - or he'll do enough damage to you that you go into the next round without as many resources as you may need. Note that Radagon will not use his ranged damage reducing move against night sorceries, making something like night comet good to bring along\n\nOne thing I did find is that Black Knife Tiche (bless her soul) is as good against him she is against most bosses. Her rot-blade or whatever nonsense she flings around can easily take 20% of his Hp by the time its DoT runs out, so she is a good one to use. She's also durable enough that she will last through both fights without issue.\n\nWith a little luck and some good timing, you can eliminate Radagon inside a minute, if not quicker, leaving you with just the follow-up fight to deal with. As a sorcerer, that one feels like a lot bigger threat!\n\nFor incantation users, Black Flame\u00a0and\u00a0Lightning Spear\u00a0are both effective punishers. Radagon also seems to be vulnerable to the Frenzied Flame spells. Frenzied Burst is highly recommended due to it's long range. For the second phase against Elden Beast, Pest Threads (at close range) deals heavy damage to large targets such as the Beast.\n\nGreatly increases magic damage negation for the caster and nearby allies.\u00a0Hold to continue praying and delay activation.\n\nThis incantation was used by the champions of the Erdtree in the First and the Second Liurnian Wars, during which the red-haired Radagon joined the heroes' ranks.\n\nGreatsword made of light, modeled after the Elden Ring itself. Forged by King Consort Radagon to proudly symbolize the tenets of the Golden Order.\n\nTelltale signs betray that this was once the greatsword bequeathed to him by his first wife, Rennala.\n\nA Moon Greatsword, bestowed by a Carian queen upon her spouse to honor long-standing tradition.\n\nRanni's sigil is a full moon, cold and leaden, and this sword is but a beam of its light.\n\nSewing needle made of gold. Unique item made to alter demigod attire.\n\nOne of the tools brought by Radagon when he entered into marriage with Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, and joined the Carian line.\n\nWhen Radagon married Rennala, he ordered the Carian magic preceptors to don these masks. To make it clear that all of their matters were to be kept strictly private.\n\nA tall crown depicting the moon. Worn by Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon. Increases intelligence.\n\nWhen Rennala, head of both the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian royal family, lost her husband Radagon, her heart went along with him.\n\nAnd then, those at the academy realized. That Rennala was no champion, after all.\n\nA Great Rune of the shardbearer Radahn.\u00a0Its blessing raises maximum HP, FP and Stamina.\n\nRadahn was amongst the children of Rennala and Radagon, who became demigod stepchildren after Radagon's union with Queen Marika.\n\nThe Great Rune burns, to resist the encroachment of the scarlet rot.\n\nA legendary talisman depicting the Elden Lord Radagon.\u00a0Shortens the casting time of sorceries and incantations.\n\nAs the husband of Rennala of Caria, the red-haired Radagon studied sorcery, and as the husband of Queen Marika, he studied\u00a0incantations. Thus did the hero aspire to be complete.\n\nRemembrance of Malenia, Goddess of Rot, hewn into the Erdtree.\n\nThe power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.\u00a0Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.\n\nMiquella and Malenia are both the children of a single god. As such they are both Empyreans, but suffered afflictions from birth. One was cursed with eternal childhood, and the other harbored rot within.\n\nA formless sacred seal depicting the ceremonial observation of Order. Enhances Golden Fundamentalist incantations.\n\nFundamentalism is scholarship in all but name. Scales incantation using both intelligence and faith.\n\nHefty whip woven from the flame-red hair of a Fire Giant.\n\nEvery giant is red of hair, and Radagon was said to have despised his own red locks. Perhaps that was a curse of their kind.\n\nHelm of the golden lion, with flowing red hair. Worn by General Radahn.\n\nRadahn inherited the furious, flaming red hair of his father Radagon, and is fond of its heroic implications.\n\n\"I was born a champion's cub. Now I am the Lord of the Battlefield's lion.\"\n\nOne of the incantations of the Golden Order fundamentalists.\u00a0A gift of gratitude to the young Miquella from his father,\u00a0Radagon.\n\nProduces a golden ring of light and fires it across a wide area.\u00a0Charging enhances range.\n\nAnd yet, the young Miquella abandoned fundamentalism, for it\u00a0could do nothing to treat Malenia's accursed rot. This was the\u00a0beginning of unalloyed gold.\n\nStone hammer made in the lands of the Numen, outside the Lands Between. The tool with which Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring and Radagon attempted to repair it.\n\nThe hammer partially broke upon shattering the Ring, becoming splintered with rune fragments.\n\nSword wrought from the remains of a god who should have lived a life eternal.\n\nThoughts on what the weapon portends are many and varied. Some consider it the mark of a great sin, or a sign of great devastation. Some think of it as the end of an age, while others; the beginning.\n\nLord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks. He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle.\n\nThe First Liurnian War Radagon's glory burns red as his hair\n\nThe Second Liurnian War No victory for the golden, nor for the moon No prize but atonement; the birth of a vow\n\nRadagon once cleansed himself with celestial dew, repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala.\n\nHe soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen.\n\nIt is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined. And so, our church holds in view the monuments of both houses. The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria.\n\nLunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Rennala. Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard.\n\nHowever, when Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between, Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort, taking the title...of second Elden Lord.\n\nThe Great Rune dwells withing the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her.\n\nYou know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret... A famed sculptor of the Erdtree Capital was once summoned to render Lord Radagon's likeness in giant stature. When he glimpsed the skeleton in Radagon's closet. And as such, it's said the great statue harbours his secret too.\n\nQueen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them.\n\nQueen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision. A god, in truth. But after the Elden Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree. A grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood.\"",

    "body": "Ranni the Witch\u00a0is an NPC in Elden Ring. Ranni the Witch\u00a0is a mysterious figure who first introduces herself as Renna. Upon meeting her again at Three Sisters, she reveals her true name and eventually will recruit you into her servitude, sending you off in search of a hidden treasure. This page covers vital information for Ranni's questline for Elden Ring.\n\nI am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path.\n\nRanni is the daughter of Radagon and Rennala, as such she is a princess of the Carian Royal Family. After Radagon departed and became the consort to Queen Marika, Ranni and her siblings were raised to demigod status, as they were now the children of the consort of a goddess. Unlike her siblings however, she was identified as a potential successor to Queen Marika by the Two Fingers,\u00a0and her status was further elevated to that of an Empyrean, and like Marika, granted her own shadow, Blaidd.\n\nShe appears to have some involvement in The Night of Black Knives, where Black Knife Assassins stole a shard of the Rune of Death and murdered\u00a0Godwyn, the Golden. At the same time, Ranni seems to have lost her original body and now resides as a spirit inhabiting an artificial doll body.\u00a0She now seeks a long-lost treasure with the\u00a0aid of her loyal followers,\u00a0War Counselor Iji, Preceptor Seluvis, her shadow Blaidd, and the Tarnished if they choose.\n\nRanni the Witch\u00a0can be found at Ranni's Rise\u00a0in the Three Sisters\u00a0sub-region of Liurnia of the Lakes\u00a0for a majority of\u00a0 Ranni's questline.\n\n\u00a7Upon defeating Rennala's first phase in Raya Lucaria Academy\n\n\u00a7After agreeing to help Sorcerer Rogier find the\u300cCursemark of Death\u300d\n\n\u00a7Serve Ranni the Witch, when first meeting her after defeating Radahn\n\n\u00a7When speaking to Miniature Ranni at the Ainsel River Main Site of Grace [must attempt to speak to her 3 times before she answers]\n\n\u00a7When speaking to Miniature Ranni at the Nokstella, Eternal City Site of Grace\n\n\u00a7When speaking to Ranni at the Nokstella\u00a0Waterfall Basin Site of Grace\n\n...after continuing forward from the Nokstella Waterfall Basin Site of Grace\n\n\u00a7Upon speaking to Miniature Ranni at her chambers Site of Grace after finishing her questline.\n\nAn honor said to have once been awarded to Carian knights who served as direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses. Now there is only one princess: Ranni, daughter of Rennala.\n\nLegendary sorcery associated with the Carian queen.\n\nUses the caster as a vessel to incarnate a cold, dark moon, then sends it floating toward foes. The dark moon dispels all sorcery that touches it, and temporarily reduces magic damage negation for those it strikes.\n\nThis moon was encountered by a young Ranni, led by the hand of her mother, Rennala. What she beheld was cold, dark and veiled in occult mystery.\n\nWitch's pointed hat, frigid and frozen through. Of a style associated with practitioners of heretical sorcery. Strengthens cold sorcery.\n\nOnce worn by the snowy crone who the young Ranni encountered deep in the woods. She was a witch, and well versed in cold sorceries. It is said that the doll that houses Ranni's soul was modeled after her.\n\nGreatsword decorated in royal Carian Style. Favored weapon of Blaidd the Half-Wolf.\n\nIn defiance of the fate he was born to, Blaidd swore to serve no master but Ranni. As proof the sword was imbued with a cold magic at the moment oath was sworn.\n\nConjures a cold magic greatsword, then delivers a sweeping blow\u00a0that launches a blade-like projectile of frost.\u00a0This sorcery can be cast repeatedly.\n\nAdula, a devourer of sorcerers, was bested by Ranni and\u00a0subsequently swore a knightly oath to her Dark Moon.\n\nSmall metal roundshield. Heavier than a wooden shield, but boasts higher damage negation.\n\nThough the effect is slight, it boosts magic damage negation and resistance to frost.\n\nCraftable item prepared using a ritual pot. Engraved with the crest of the Carian Royals.\n\nOriginates from the cold, dark moon of Ranni, the Carian princess.\n\nA Great Rune of the shardbearer Radahn.\u00a0Its blessing raises maximum HP, FP and Stamina.\n\nRadahn was amongst the children of Rennala and Radagon, who became demigod stepchildren after Radagon's union with Queen Marika.\n\nThe Great Rune burns, to resist the encroachment of the scarlet rot.\n\nA slab of rock engraved with traces of the Rune of Death.\n\nOn the night of the dire plot, Ranni rewarded Praetor Rykard with these traces. Should the coming trespass one day transpire, they would serve as a last-resort foil, allowing Rykard to challenge Maliketh the Black Blade, the black beast of Destined Death.\n\nCursemark carved into the discarded flesh of Ranni the Witch.\u00a0Also known as the half-wheel wound of the centipede.\n\nThis cursemark was carved at the moment of Death of the first demigod,\u00a0and should have taken the shape of a circle.\n\nHowever, two demigods perished at the same time,\u00a0breaking the cursemark into two half-wheels.\u00a0Ranni was the first of the demigods whose flesh perished,\u00a0while the Prince of Death perished in soul alone.\n\nThe hidden treasure of the Eternal City of Nokron; a blade said to have been born of a corpse.\n\nThis blood-drenched fetish is proof of the high treason committed by the Eternal City and symbolizes its downfall.\n\nCannot be wielded by those without a fate, but is said to be able to harm the Greater Will and its vassals.\n\nA key discarded by Lunar Princess Ranni alongside her very flesh.\n\nOpens a treasure chest passed down to Carian Princesses.\n\nIt is said to be found in the Grand Library of Raya Lucaria with her mother Rennala.\n\nRing depicting a leaden full moon. Symbolic of a cold oath, the ring is supposed to be given by Lunar Princess Ranni to her consort.\n\nRanni is an Empyrean, meaning her consort would by rights earn the title of lord.\u00a0A warning is engraved within; \"Whoever thou mayest be, take not the ring from this place, the solitude beyond the night is better mine alone.\"\n\nA Moon Greatsword, bestowed by a Carian queen upon her\u00a0spouse to honor long-standing tradition.\u00a0One of the legendary armaments.\n\nRanni's sigil is a full moon, cold and leaden, and this sword is but a beam of its light.\n\nNow, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives. Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Rennala. Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard. Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint. Truly, you have my thanks. But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you. If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night, then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh. I would like you to procure it for me. And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.\n\nI have some idea of Ranni's potential whereabouts. There's a manor to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends. There's been talk of the old royals' vassals gathering there in recent years. Ranni's whereabouts since the Shattering are a well-kept secret. She hasn't been seen even once. But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born...\n\nI see... When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too. You know, not everyone would trust such a tale... But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess... Then perhaps it's true after all.\n\nOh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything. Again, I am Iji. The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor. I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd. I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray for your success. My apologies for the misleading words of warning. I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate. I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not. Do forgive me, my fellow. Let us give all that we can of ourselves. Together, for Lady Ranni.\n\nBlaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother. Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood. They were always happy to have me tag along, as well. When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean, Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals, but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together. Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you? The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you.\n\nAh, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything. You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars. The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all. There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgment of character. Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened. Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave. And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.\n\nOh, there you are. Good of you to drop by. Have you heard? Lady Ranni has departed on her journey. Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna\u2019s Rise, as she calls it. It would not have been possible without you. As Lady Ranni\u2019s war counselor, and moreover, her childhood warden, I express my deepest gratitude. You, and only you, were Lady Ranni\u2019s true champion.\u00a0My purpose is nearing its end. I've served Lady Ranni for as long as I can remember...It has been a long and wondrous journey. Now Lady Ranni is in your hands. I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end.\n\nAhh, long time, friend. Blaidd, if you\u2019ve forgotten. Glad to have you in the service of mistress Ranni.\n\nHmm\u2026 So Ranni\u2019s fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn\u2026 That reminds me of something I heard. There\u2019s a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wilds, east of Limgrave. It\u2019s a festival of combat. And I heard\u2026 that you can fight Radahn himself. He who was once called the strongest of all the demigods\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s just a coincidence, but I think it\u2019s worth investigating. I\u2019ll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then\u2026 You\u2019re coming too, right? To Radahn\u2019s festivities\u2026 I\u2019ll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid. The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.\n\nAh, there you are. Took your sweet time. The players are all made up, and waiting for the curtain\u2026 Let\u2019s give them a show to remember, eh. Just don\u2019t you go dying on me. For Ranni\u2019s sake, too.\n\nAh, good. I was waiting for you. What a sick way to fight, eh. The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you. And hah! Did you see that, afterwards? A falling star, right before our eyes! I can\u2019t fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale. He was a living legend, if ever I saw one. And, the path has now been cleared. To Nokron, where Ranni\u2019s fate will be decided. Let\u2019s meet where the falling star bit the earth. We\u2019ll take up our swords once more. For mistress Ranni.\n\nOh, it's you... It's me, Blaidd. Old Iji trapped me here. Told me I'd bring nought but bale to Lady Ranni. But there's no chance that could happen. I'm part of her being. Her very shadow... I thought old Iji knew as much... Honestly, I don't know what's going on anymore...\n\nMy thanks, friend. I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now. I don't know what came over old Iji, but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe. Now, Ranni can finally set in motion the fight against her fate she's dreamt of for so long.\n\nNo. I\u2019m part of her very being! I could never betray her! No matter what might happen... Ranni... She needs me...",

    "body": "Miquella, also known as Miquella\u00a0the Kind or\u00a0Kindly Miquella, is a background character in\u00a0Elden Ring\u00a0and a central character\u00a0in Shadow of the Erdtree. One of the Empyrean children born from the union of Queen Marika\u00a0and Radagon, he is the twin brother of Malenia, together known as the Twin Prodigies. It is revealed that Miquella has stripped himself of his flesh and Empyrean lineage\u00a0in the Land of Shadow, a place obscured by the Erdtree and purged in an unsung war.\n\nMy brother will keep his promise. He possesses the wisdom, the allure, of a god - he is the most fearsome Empyrean of all.\" - Malenia\n\nMiquella the Kind...is a monster. Pure and radiant, he wields love to shrive clean the hearts of men. There is nothing more terrifying.\" -\u00a0Sir Ansbach\n\nMiquella is cursed to be perpetually young. He is said to be well loved as a demigod and has the ability to compel affection from others (see Bewitching Branch). This is why Malenia considers him the most fearsome Empyrean.\n\nMiquella and Malenia were very close, with her becoming his sworn blade and protector. Like his half-sister Ranni, Miquella would be chosen by the Two Fingers as a potential successor to Queen Marika. Originally a fundamentalist, as well as possessing genius intellect, he would develop incantations for his father (see Discus of Light and\u00a0Triple Rings of Light) and peculiarities such as the\u00a0Pulley Bow. However, he would become disillusioned with the Golden Order after it was unable to cure Malenia\u00a0from her Scarlet Rot (see Radagon's Rings of Light), nor grant his half-brother Godwyn\u00a0a true death (see Golden Epitaph). This compelled him towards\u00a0a different path, one of Unalloyed Gold (see Miquella's Needle), and like Ranni, he would\u00a0seek to purge the Lands Between from the influence of Outer Gods.\n\nMiquella is described as benevolent, kind of heart, and envisioned a world where all would be accepted\u00a0(see Light of Miquella). However, in the base game it is heavily hinted that Miquella used others for his own ends, which is later confirmed during the events in the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion.\n\nMiquella created the Haligtree to allow himself to grow to be an adult and to provide shelter to those without grace, such as the Albinaurics, an oppressed race of artificial beings who sees the Haligtree as the chosen land. Before he could\u00a0grow the Haligtree to its full potential, Miquella was stolen by his half-brother,\u00a0Mohg, Lord of Blood, in his cocoon form, and taken to Mohgwyn Palace. Mohg wished to\u00a0have Miquella elevated to godhood with himself as Miquella's consort through the\u00a0Formless Mother,\u00a0however, Mohg's advances were not reciprocated (see Remembrance of the Blood Lord).\n\nIt is later revealed in Shadow of the Erdtree by Sir Ansbach, one of Mohg's former disciples,\u00a0that Mohg was enchanted by Miquella, and that\u00a0Mohg\u00a0was used by Miquella\u00a0merely as a means to gain entry to the Land of Shadow. Mohg's corpse would later be\u00a0defiled and repurposed as a vessel for the soul of Miquella's promised consort.\n\nAs if using Lord Mohg to gain entrance to the land of shadow were not enough, he plans to use his corpse as the vessel of his king consort. He has forsaken Lord Mohg's soul. He desires only his empty shell. It beggars belief, but\u2026 I'm afraid Tender Miquella fails to grasp the humiliation implied by this act. One thing is certain. My dear lord deserved better.\" - Sir Ansbach\n\nMiquella is said to be waiting for\u00a0his promised lord in the Land of Shadow. There, he has abandoned his flesh (see Miquella's Cross), his fate (see St. Trina), as well as his own Empyrean lineage - a lineage secured by Marika through what appears to be a great war and a massacre carried out by Messmer the Impaler.\n\nNo matter our efforts if the roots are rotten, then we have little recourse. Ever-young Miquella saw things for what they were. He knew that his bloodline was tainted. His roots mired in madness. A tragedy if ever there was one. That he would feel compelled to renounce everything. When the blame lay squarely with the mother.\" - Count Ymir\n\nIt is revealed in Shadow of the Erdtree that Miquella seeks entry to the Tower of Shadow (the true form as\u00a0Enir-Ilim).\u00a0There he wishes to ascend to godhood through the Gate of Divinity, which Queen Marika once used to ascend, and bring forth the Age of Compassion (see Circlet of Light and\u00a0Miquella's Great Rune). He dispossesses\u00a0himself of his flesh to prepare for his ascension, but in doing so, loses himself and what he once was. Mohg's corpse\u00a0is then used as a vessel for\u00a0his half-brother\u00a0Radahn. Miquella admired Radahn's qualities, which contrast that of his afflicted self (see Remembrance of a God and a Lord).\n\nIn the endgame flashback cutscene, it is revealed that Miquella had long planned his ascension and made a promise\u00a0with Radahn\u00a0to be his consort. It is also revealed that Malenia knew of their promise\u00a0(see Young Lion's Armor) and reminded Radahn of it during their battle in Caelid. Though following this revelation, it is\u00a0unclear\u00a0why Malenia went into conflict with Radahn\u00a0and unleashed her scarlet rot in the first place. One possible explanation is that the promise\u00a0was not mutual, and Malenia sought to coerce Radahn into agreement. This is possibly supported by the fact that those with strength, such as the Tarnished, seem particularly resistant to Miquella's charm (Leda comments on this after aiding her twice, mentioning that the Tarnished is seemingly identical before and after Miquella's rune was broken). However, Miquella mentions a vow independent of his promise with Radahn, suggesting that the two may have entered\u00a0a mutual contract\u00a0of some kind\u00a0before the promise was made that Radahn was expected to uphold.\n\nLord brother. I'm going to be a god. If we honour our part of the vow, promise me you'll be my consort. I'll make the world a gentler place.\" - Miquella\n\nI hereby swear. Lord brother. To every living being, and every living soul.At long last, you are returned. Now comes the age of our eden.A thousand year voyage guided by compassion. Tarnished one.Beginning here, love encompasses all. Aspiring Lord of the old order.No living thing will be denied, no deed censured.If you have known sin, if you grieve for this world,I am ready. To embrace the whole of it.Then yield the path forward to us.Let us go together. To I, Miquella, Radahn, my promised consort.and my promised consort, Radahn.\n\nRemembrance of Malenia, Goddess of Rot, hewn into the Erdtree.\n\nThe power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.\u00a0Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.\n\nMiquella and Malenia are both the children of a single god. As such they are both Empyreans, but suffered afflictions from birth. One was cursed with eternal childhood, and the other harbored rot within.\n\nA delicate water lily of unalloyed gold that has started to fade and wilt. Material used for crafting items. Exeedingly rare to find.\n\nA flower signifying faith in the Haligtree. Thought to be beloved by the Empyrean Miquella in his youth.\n\nAn arcane butterfly with translucent wings. Material used for crafting items. Exceedingly rare to find.\n\nThis butterfly appears as if it's just emerged from its cocoon for its entire life.\n\nA sword made to commemorate the death of Godwyn the Golden, first of the demigods to die.\n\nInfused with the humble prayer of a young boy; \"O brother, lord brother, please die a true death.\"\n\nOne of the incantations of the Golden Order fundamentalists.\u00a0A gift of gratitude to the young Miquella from his father,\u00a0Radagon.\n\nProduces a golden ring of light and fires it across a wide area.\u00a0Charging enhances range.\n\nAnd yet, the young Miquella abandoned fundamentalism, for it\u00a0could do nothing to treat Malenia's accursed rot. This was the\u00a0beginning of unalloyed gold.\n\nTree branch blessed with an incantation of unalloyed gold. Craftable item.\n\nPierce a foe, using FP to turn them into a temporary ally.\n\nThe Empyrean Miquella is loved by many people. Indeed, he has learned very well how to compel such affection.\n\nSilver sword carried by clerics of St. Trina. Inflicts sleep ailment upon foes.\n\nSt. Trina is an enigmatic figure. Some say she is a comely young girl, others are sure he is a boy. The only certainty is that their appearance was as sudden as their disappearance.\n\nThe surcoat bears the crest of the Haligtree. Though watered with\u00a0Miquella's\u00a0own\u00a0blood\u00a0since it was a sapling, the Haligtree ultimately failed to grow into an\u00a0Erdtree.\n\nRemembrance of Mohg, Lord of Blood, hewn into the Erdtree.\n\nThe power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.\u00a0Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.\n\nWishing to raise Miquella to full godhood, Mohg wished to be his consort, taking the role of monarch.\u00a0But no matter how much of his bloody bedchamber he tried to share, he received no response from the young Empyrean.\n\nWinged helm made of unalloyed gold.\u00a0Worn by Malenia, Blade of Miquella.\n\n\u201cMy brother will keep his promise. He possesses the wisdom, the allure, of a god \u2013 he is the most fearsome Empyrean of all.\u201d\n\nOne of the unalloyed gold needles that Miquella crafted to ward away the meddling of outer gods.\n\nCapable of subduing the flame of frenzy if inherited, allowing one to cheat fate and avoid becoming Lord of Frenzied Flame.\n\nHowever, the needle is as yet unfinished and can only be used in the heart of the storm beyond time said to be found in Farum\u00a0Azula.\n\nA Great Rune relinquished by Miquella. Broken and bereft of its bounty, it retains naught but the power to resist charms.\n\nMiquella set off for the tower enshrouded by shadow, abandoning everything\u2014his golden flesh, his blinding strength, even his fate. All in an effort to bury the original sin. To embrace the whole of it, and be reborn as a new god.\n\nRemembrance of Radahn, consort of Miquella, hewn into the Scadutree.\n\nThe power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.\n\nIn their childhood, Miquella saw in Radahn a lord. His strength, and his kindness, that stood in stark contrast with their afflicted selves.\n\nAnd so Miquella made his heartfelt wish. That Radahn would one day be his king consort.\n\nThe circlet of light which adorned Miquella's head as he returned in divine aspect. It has begun to fade into nothingness.\n\nSlightly boosts intelligence, faith, and arcane, while also boosting the power of Miquella's light.\n\nThis circle was to be the very foundation upon which Miquella's age of compassion would be built, should it have ever come to pass.\n\nThe strength of Miquella upon his deific return, wielded as an incantation.\n\nMiquella sought to accept all that was and would be, but found one that refused to be embraced.\n\nNo wonder, as one god, and one king consort, is all the world needs.\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River\u00a0\u00a0\u2666\u00a0\u00a0Aeonian

She is the Empyrean twin sister of Miquella and\u00a0gained renown for her legendary battle against Starscourge Radahn during the Shattering, in which she unleashed the power of the Scarlet Rot and reduced Caelid to ruins. This is an optional boss, as players do not need to defeat her in order to advance in Elden Ring.\n\n...Heed my words. I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella. And I have never known defeat.\n\nMalenia is located at the bottom of Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree. Her arena is immediately down the stairs from the Haligtree Roots Site of Grace. [Map Link]\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs. The values after the \"/\"s indicate the increased resistances after each successive proc.\n\nMalenia, Blade of Miquella is a two-phase fight, with the second phase beginning once her health is reduced to zero for the first time.\n\nPhase one: Malenia is slightly less aggressive and will mostly only attack if the player tries to attack her. Additionally, if the player does not target lock the camera on her, she is likely to stay away from the player just walking left and right. Use this to your advantage when you need some breathing room - for example, to drink a healing flask. If attacked with projectiles, she will attempt to dodge them and then rush at the player to attack them. Malenia has a few attacks that she can use to quickly close the gap, the most notable of these is her grab attack, which deals obscene amounts of damage, thus healing her for a big amount. If Malenia takes too much damage, she will attempt to disengage by jumping backwards 2 times, distancing herself from the player.\n\nOnce Malenia goes below 75% HP, she unlocks her Waterfowl Dance attack: she leaps into the air with her sword ready and, after a brief pause, lunges at the player four times with a flurry of cuts. The third leap has more range than the two before it. The fourth leap has massive range, and Malenia will attempt to get behind the player with it. After this final fourth flurry, a final cut strikes around her. All steps of this attack deal massive damage, getting hit by it all will very likely kill the player even at full health. Read the attacks & counter section for tips on how to avoid this attack.\n\nAfter getting Malenia to 0 health, a cutscene plays and phase 2 starts with Malenia at 80% health. Note that critical attacks will not trigger phase 2, and Malenia will survive them even if she has 0 health. Only a non-critical attack will work.\n\nPhase two: Malenia, floating in the air, rapidly crashes on the player using Scarlet Aeonia dealing massive damage, then blooms into an orange flower which deals massive damage and inflicts massive amounts of Scarlet Rot. To dodge it, simply run towards Malenia and get behind her, she will miss because she cannot steer that much while charging the attack. Malenia will repeat this attack every 3 minutes.\n\nEach of Malenia's attacks in this phase inflicts Scarlet Rot, the player should ensure they have Preserving Boluses to cleanse this condition should they be afflicted.\n\nIn addition to all her previous attacks and the aforementioned Scarlet Aeonia, Malenia gains a few new attacks in this phase. Most notably, as a follow-up to other sword attacks, Malenia can jump and then slam her sword into the ground to create a delayed explosion. Finally, Malenia can leap very high into the air, leaving behind her a small vortex of rot that deals massive damage, she will then summon phantoms of herself to lunge at the player one after the other, before finally lunging herself.\n\nWhile standing on the shallow water puddle in the middle of the arena, Malenia (and the player) gain 10% damage reduction to Fire Damage and lose 10% damage reduction to Lightning Damage.\n\nWhen you use ranged attacks, perfumes, or throwables, Malenia will dodge to the side and then charge at you. It\u2019s best to use spells or incantations that can follow her movements. When her health drops to 75%, she starts using Waterfowl Dance. She will still dodge ranged attacks but might follow up with this powerful move. You can also use summons to distract Malenia \u2014 this allows you to use ranged attacks safely off of distance.\u00a0Also,\u00a0Night Sorceries will not trigger her evasion, as they are invisible to NPCs.\n\nAfter dodging Malenia\u2019s Scarlet Aeonia attack by moving behind her, you\u2019ll have about 5-7 seconds to attack her. This is a good time to use strong ranged attacks or spells with DoT area effects. If you have enough FP, using Comet Azur can take a big chunk of her health before she becomes active again. You can repeat this strategy each time she uses Scarlet Aeonia for heavy damage.\n\nIf Malenia is running at you at the start of the fight, she will proceed to rush you with a horizontal spinning attack once you are in range. This attack is telegraphed and easily parried. If you're not good at parrying, then dodge toward Malenia's left side (the player's right). If she slows down or starts moving left or right, she will not do the spin attack.\n\nIn order to avoid her Waterfowl Dance combo you must start running away from her while maintaining lock-on as soon as she leaps, which will let you avoid the first two spin attacks entirely if done soon enough (if not you will have to roll the second one). The third spin attack has to be rolled through, and make sure to stay away from her until the final AoE triggers. If you are caught by the attack, it is better to roll towards her than away; the extreme edges of the attack seem to have more hitboxes.\n\nAsh of War: Bloodhound's Step makes dodging Waterfowl Dance significantly easier. Using that ability, you can completely avoid the combo, even if you're close to Malenia when she starts its windup. Dash away from her, out of range of the first and second flurries (possibly multiple times depending on how far away she is), and toward her (once) to avoid the third flurry. (During the third flurry she jumps to you regardless of the distance, but the first and second flurries have a fixed jump range.)\n\nIn Phase 2, make sure you are constantly topped up to full HP. Many of her basic combo attacks are strong enough to deal well over 1000 damage to heavy armor users very quickly, so sitting at 80% HP or below to save on flasks is liable to get you killed.\n\nA weapon with the Ash of War: Wild Strikes and the blood affinity can trivialize the first phase of the fight.\n\nAsh of War: Golden Parry is useful for easily parrying most of her attacks. The increased parry range and window can be of tremendous help to players with less experience in parrying her attacks.\n\nThe main trick here is to attack her when she's not in an attack animation in order to stagger her, typically after she is done with a combo. Once you hit her and it staggers her, keep attacking to keep the stagger going while paying attention to when she side hops as this interrupts the stagger. When she does so, roll out of the way, keep some distance, and dodge her attacks until you get another opening, while keeping a keen eye on the startup for her waterfowl dance, to which you should run away from the first two volleys and dodge through the final volley. Be mindful of your positioning at all times, you do not want your back to a wall when she does her waterfowl dance. Stay calm, do not panic, watch some videos of her attacks, and you'll realize her flashy moves just seemed intimidating/impossible at first. Do not rely on a shield to do the work for you due to her healing ability, at most you should only use it to block the stray hit. Talisman suggestions would be Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman (or your best one), Ritual Shield Talisman, and Green Turtle Talisman to help mitigate damage and improve stamina regeneration. The Prelate's Charge skill can be used to stagger her by driving her into a corner as long as you have enough FP.\n\nIn her second phase her attacks start to flow together more, but good ones to punish are her slamming attacks as she takes some time to create a rot burst in front of her.\n\nRivers of Blood and Blasphemous Blade are great options for weapons. If focusing on bleed damage, Curved Swords are a good choice as their dual-wielded jumping attack hits four times allowing quick Bleed build-up. This can be paired with the Raptor's Black Feathers, Claw Talisman, Beastman's Curved Sword, and Rotten Winged Sword Insignia for high DPS. The Scavenger's Curved Sword dual wielded with a\u00a0curved sword\u00a0with bleed affinity is a good choice for such a build. For Strength Arcane builds, Mohgwyn's Sacred Spear can be used for inflicting bleed from a distance rapidly by using the\u00a0Bloodboon Ritual weapon skill.\n\nFor Incantation users, Swarm of Flies is a good option when summoning, especially Black Knife Tiche Ashes. Once Malenia focuses on Tiche, start casting Swarm of Flies. A slight delay between casts is a little more effective than constant spam, as it seems to catch her fully in each swarm rather than clipping her as she dodges out. If she leaps, just keep your distance and get ready to dodge Waterfowl Dance. With luck, one of your swarms will cause blood loss and she'll be staggered, but because you're keeping range, you should be able to dodge much, if not all, of the Waterfowl Dance. On phase 2, the recovery of Scarlet Aeonia is the perfect time to spam Swarm of Flies.\n\nOther good incantations are Borealis's Mist to inflict Frostbite, Giantsflame Take Thee for its massive damage and high chance to knock Malenia down, Aspect of the Crucible: Tail and Aspect of the Crucible: Horns to knock down Malenia, or Dragonmaw which deals good damage and knocks her down. Protect yourself with both Golden Vow and Black Flame's Protection as they stack. Don't use offensive Holy incantations because Malenia has 40% damage reduction against Holy damage. Rotten Breath or Ekzyke's Decay are not terrible, but Malenia does have very high resistance to Scarlet Rot and Poison. For INT+FTH builds, Ancient Death Rancor is also a very good option, as it deals good damage, has good poise damage, and good tracking.\n\nFor Sorcery users, starting the fight with Ranni's Dark Moon can be helpful as it lowers her magic resistance and deals frostbite damage.\n\nDo not use projectile attacks such as Great Glintstone Shard because she will just dodge them. Instead, use sorceries with good tracking capabilities such as the aforementioned moon or Stars of Ruin. Malenia, as all other NPCs, cannot see Night Sorceries so she will not dodge them, making Night Comet a fantastic option especially when paired with a Staff of Loss on the other hand to buff its damage (or, even better, with two Staves of Loss if you can get a second one from another player or a new game + playthrough).\n\nOther good sorceries against her are Greatblade Phalanx for its high stance damage, which can be good if playing with a weapon that can inflict critical attacks once you stagger her, but this is not as good for pure mages that only use staves. Carian Piercer and Cannon of Haima are also good for knocking her down. For INT+FTH builds, Ancient Death Rancor is also a very good option, as it deals good damage, has good stance damage, and good tracking.\n\nIf using summons, Malenia might dodge fewer projectiles as she's busy focusing on the summon. This opens the door for spells such as Comet or Shard Spiral. Alternatively, spamming Ranni's Dark Moon while Malenia focuses on the summons is also a valid strategy, though this requires a lot of FP. If not spamming Dark Moon, Glinstone Icecrag can help trigger Frostbite. Finally, Comet Azur can be considered for phase 2 to punish Malenia\u00a0after dodging\u00a0her Scarlet Aeonia.\n\nAttack not used in current version of the game. However, if player wants to face her in 1.00 version of the game, it is best to simply run away\n\nThere are several methods in dodging the attack, the method depends on the distance between you and her:\n\n1) If you are distanced about four or more meters out of her sword's reach, immediately start running back the moment she leaps in the air. The first two slashes will miss as long as you keep running. Immediately stop running after she finishes her second slash and roll towards her, the third slash will miss since it's programmed to send her behind you. If you've timed this right the fourth slash will miss as well without requiring any additional inputs from you.\n\n2) If she jumps up while you're within her sword's reach, immediately start running back. The timing is precise and requires some training. The moment her foot touches the ground to begin the first slash, jump or roll away from her, this move will dodge the first slash. She'll now wind up her second slash, move towards her while keeping your eyes on her sword arm, then roll towards her left arm (right side from your POV) the moment her sword arm starts to move for a second slash. If timed right this will dodge her second slash. For the third slash, simply roll towards her again and then roll away from her to avoid the fourth slash.\n\n3) If you have a weapon with high bleed build-up (such as dual curved swords with Ash of War: Seppuku), the bleed effect will stagger her out of the Waterfowl Dance attack.\n\n4) Ash of War: Bloodhound Step can also be used to easily dodge through this attack. You can apply the Ash of War to an off-hand dagger and quickly switch to it whenever she begins the Waterfowl Dance animation.\n\n5) Ash of War: Vow of the Indomitable can be used to partially dodge the first volley with the right timing. The I-frames don't last long enough to completely dodge the first volley, but you can dodge afterwards and still take no damage.\n\nAnother way to dodge this attack when you're at close range (albeit a lot more difficult), is to circle her (without locking-on) when she's in the air, double roll away from her for the first dash, lock-on to her again and do the same thing as above for the other three dashes. Alternatively, block with a shield that has relatively high stability. She will recover her health, but it is more preferable than dying. At this point in the game you should deal enough damage to make up for health regained.\n\nNote: She tends to use this attack more often, if she is engaged with range weaponry/spells (needs further testing).\n\nNote: The healing values on waterfowl dance requires more testing as it is very difficult to ensure the entire attack connects and be able to tell which attacks are healing her. Datamining indicates that there is an internal 0.3 second cooldown on each of Malenia's healing effects which would explain why she only heals from some of the hits.\n\nTesting with her animation speed slowed 50x suggests that waterfowl dance dance hits up to 18 times, healing her for either 1.6% or 0.4% each hit. The internal cooldown only affects attacks using the same healing effect (so after she heals for 1.6%, she cannot trigger another 1.6% heal for 0.3 seconds, but there is no delay between triggering heals for different amounts).\n\nMalenia will rush the player before she swipes at the player with her leg (unparryable), which can then be followed up by one of four attacks. A slightly delayed stabbing dash attack, a sword swipe followed up by an overhead slam on the ground, or two quick slices followed by another slice. It can also be followed up with a grab attack (see below).\n\nThe kick is fairly easy to avoid. Creating distance can keep you safe from the latter two follow ups. The stabbing dash attack is telegraphed by a small flash on her sword, helping you time a roll. The kick can also be blocked, but consumes high amounts of stamina.\n\nMalenia will slightly jump into the air, followed by a very quick thrusting attack, dealing a huge amount of pierce damage. This attack usually catches player off-guard. Can be parried at melee.\n\nMalenia usually does this attack when the player is healing at mid-range. So if you want to heal, make sure to run far away from her first before healing, or wait for the thrust before healing. To avoid the thrust, simply roll left or right (backwards works as well but it's a bit risky). Because of pierce damage, this attack deals increased damage if the player is in counterattack frames. If the player is far enough away from her, it's possible to jump over the thrust. If the player is close enough, they can parry it.\n\nMalenia will shorten her blade (indicated by a ping sound) then rush the player, do three quick attacks in succession, followed by a final horizontal attack that can be delayed. This attack can end up quickly healing her along with devastating the player's health. This attack can also occur on its own, in the middle of a combo, or to end a combo (usually indicated by her delaying the final sweep). Can be parried.\n\nMalenia uses this attack only if her blade is to her right (the player's left if they are looking at her) which means you can be better prepared for it. Listen for the ping sound to indicate the weapon change, then roll towards her (into the attack) to her right. Back up and if needed roll away from her once you are clear to avoid the final sweep.\n\nDo not rush in for an attack unless the final sweep is delayed, which would indicate the end of a combo and an opening for the player. Avoid dodging backwards, as the third hit will clip you. She may sometimes follow it up with the same attack - this can happen multiple times in a row.\n\nMalenia will hold her sword back, then do one of the two damaging attacks depending on the player's location: (i) If the player is at close range, she will do an uppercut, then leap upwards and slams down. (ii) If the player is at long range, she will charge towards the player at fast speed, then spin her sword, followed by a slam.\n\nThe two attacks are very delayed and extremely damaging, so make sure you recognize the starting animation (indicated by her holding her sword back) immediately and be prepared for the attacks. For Uppercut + Slam: Roll backwards to avoid the uppercut, then wait for her to slam down and roll forward left or forward right. If you are brave enough, you can get a few hits in before her uppercut, then dodge at the very last second. For Charge + Spin: Roll twice as soon as you see her charging towards you to dodge both the spin and the slam altogether. Malenia will be wide open for attacks after performing these two attacks. You can either do a charged strong attack or even a weapon's skills such as Lion's Claw or Spinning Slash.\n\nHeals Malenia for 1.6% max HP per swing, Overhead slam heals for 3.2% max HP\n\nMalenia will raise her hand in preparation for a grab attack, then lunge in a straight line towards the player very quickly. If the grab connects she will toss the player into the air and impale them, dealing 2225 base thrusting damage, before tossing their body onto the ground. During Phase two, this attack can be immediately followed by a flying sweep + thrust attack. This attack cannot be blocked or parried.\n\nDodge roll when Malenia lunges, preferablyto the sides (backwards works too if you time it right). During Phase two, be prepared for the flying sweep + thrust attack (See below) as it may catch the player off-guard. While this attack can be interrupted by most player attacks while she winds up the grab, it's not suggested to do so because of the risks.\n\nRoll as soon as you see her sword is lifted, then sprint away for her for a little bit (around half a second), then roll away from her again. Remember to not attack her right away after the explosion as the rot will linger for quite a bit (around 4 - 5 seconds), use this time window to heal, recover FP, reapply buffs, or even cast some spells if you're a ranged user. After the scarlet rot is gone (indicated by the flower disappearing), she will be unable to move for a while, and is wide open for attacks, use this time window to use your skill (or a charged strong attack) on her to deal massive damage in a single hit.\n\nThis attack usually occur when she is done with her regular Phase one combo. Roll in any direction to avoid the slam, roll again if you're unsure whether exploson will hit you. This attack can be heavily punished if you roll into her and get to her back, as she will be wide open for attacks after the slam. To differentiate between this attack and the Waterfowl Dance (as these two attacks have similar starting animation), if she twirls before flying up, it's the Waterfowl Dance; if she flies upwards without twirling, she's doing the Scarlet Explosion attack.\n\nShe will usually do this attack when you're at long range. Roll left to avoid the first sweep, then roll left or right to avoid the thrust. Or, roll the sweep, then jump the thrust. See above to learn how to dodge the Scarlet Explosion follow-up. Because of pierce damage, the follow up thrust attack deals increased damage if the player is in counterattack frames.\n\nRoll in the directions as the following order: Backwards twice (delay a bit between these two rolls), followed by two forward rolls (immediately after one another), then roll to the left twice (immediately after one another). The timing for the third and fourth roll might be a bit difficult to get a grasp on (and will usually result in death as you'll get hit by two phantoms), but once you get those two rolls right, you'll never get hit by the phantoms.\n\nThe final dive attack heals Malenia for 10.6% max HP\n\nDefeating player in phase 1 (1.00): Now do you understand? I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella...\n\nDefeating player in phase 1 (after 1.00): I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella...\n\nDefeating player in phase 2: Let your flesh be consumed. By the scarlet rot.\n\nRemembrance of Malenia, Goddess of Rot, hewn into the Erdtree.\n\nThe power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.\u00a0Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.\n\nMiquella and Malenia are both the children of a single god. As such they are both Empyreans, but suffered afflictions from birth. One was cursed with eternal childhood, and the other harbored rot within.\n\nA Great Rune of the shardbearer Malenia. The blessing of this half-rotted rune reduces the healing power of Flask of Crimson Tears.\n\nAnd yet, due to the infusion of Malenia's spirit of resistance. attacks made immediately after receiving damage will partially recover HP.\n\nMalenia is daughter to Queen Marika and Radagon, and her Great Rune should have been the most sacred of all.\n\nA talisman engraved with a scene from a heroic tale.\u00a0Raises dexterity.\n\nThough born into the accursed rot, when the young girl encountered her mentor and his flowing blade, she gained wings\u00a0of unparalleled strength.\n\nGolden prosthesis once used by the one-armed valkyrie. A masterwork of craftsmanship, with practice and skill it can be used as proficiently as a real arm.\n\nWhen Maleigh Marais, Lord of the Shaded Castle, embraced this prosthesis, he claimed to feel the presence of his personal goddess.\n\nRobe with a black mantle across the shoulders. Customarily worn by the head of House Marais.\n\nThe sons of House Marais are all sickly born.\u00a0Little wonder that Maleigh Marais would be so beguiled by the beautiful and fierce goddess who was born into rot.\n\nOne of the incantations of the Golden Order fundamentalists. A gift of gratitude to the young Miquella from his father, Radagon.\n\nProduces a golden ring of light and fires it across a wide area. Charging enhances range.\n\nAnd yet, the young Miquella abandoned fundamentalism, for it could do nothing to treat Malenia's accursed rot. This was the beginning of unalloyed gold.\n\nBlade built into Malenia's prosthetic arm.\u00a0Through consecration it is resistant to rot.\n\nMalenia's war prosthesis symbolized her victories.\u00a0Some claim to have seen wings when the weapon was raised aloft;\u00a0wings of fierce determination that have never known defeat.\n\nA talisman depicting a raised prosthetic blade. An honor bestowed upon the knights who fought alongside Malenia the Severed.\n\nThe wings symbolize Malenia and her undefeated prowess. Though she never knew relief from the accursed rot she was born into, her blade was forever beautiful - and relentless.\n\nArmor\u00a0of the Cleanrot Knights, celebrated for their undefeated campaign in the Shattering.\n\nThe Cleanrot Knights vowed to fight alongside Malenia, despite the inevitable, if gradual, putrefaction of their flesh. Their acceptance of their fate made these battles fiercest of all.\n\nCreates a gigantic flower that blooms into an explosion of scarlet\u00a0rot.\n\nEach time the scarlet flower blooms, Malenia's rot advances. It has\u00a0bloomed twice already. With the third bloom, she will become a\u00a0true goddess.\n\nA butterfly with withered, scarlet wings found in the swamp of Aeonia. Material used for crafting items.\n\nAccording to myth, these butterflies were once the wings of the Goddess of Rot herself.\n\nLegendary ashen remains.\u00a0Use to summon the spirit of the Cleanrot Knight Finlay.\n\nFinlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia, who in an unimaginable act of heroism carried the slumbering demigod Malenia all the way back to the Haligtree. She managed the feat alone, fending off all manner of foes along the way.\n\nWinged helm made of unalloyed gold.\u00a0Worn by Malenia, Blade of Miquella.\n\n\u201cMy brother will keep his promise. He possesses the wisdom, the allure, of a god \u2013 he is the most fearsome Empyrean of all.\u201d\n\nAn intricately crafted needle of unalloyed gold. Removed by\u00a0Millicent\u00a0from her flesh.\n\nBears no trace of befouled blood, but is faintly moist with dew.\n\n\"There is something I must return to\u00a0Malenia. The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the\u00a0scarlet rot.\"\n\nThe golden armor worn by Radahn in his younger years. Proudly adorned with heroic red accents, it is fitting attire for a lion.\n\nWhen Malenia, Blade of Miquella, let the rotflower blossom in Aeonia, Radahn heard a murmur in his ear\u2014 \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"\n\nDo you have an interest in rot incantations?\u00a0Then you might like to learn something of the history...\u00a0of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot.\u00a0Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon\u00a0were blessed with twin demigods,\u00a0and Malenia was one of them.\n\nShe was born an Empyrean,\u00a0carrying the scarlet rot.\u00a0An Empyrean...is no mere demigod.\u00a0In the age of the Elden Ring,\u00a0and Queen Marika,\u00a0the precious Empyrean was born.\u00a0A new god to forge a new Order.\n\nSince Malenia fought Radahn,\u00a0and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia,\u00a0I have dedicated myself to her.\u00a0And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot.\u00a0The cycle of decay and rebirth.\n\nSever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly. When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn. As a scarlet valkyrie.\n\nWould you disown us too? As your Mother did? We children of the scarlet rot? Millicent... Malenia... Do you detest us, so utterly?\n\nNow, I'm tracing the path Malenia took, after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn,in the Caelid Wilds. I should like to meet her, this vanished woman. I think she's in the north. In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.\n\nI'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins. I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree. Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found. The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands.\n\nI am of Malenia's blood. But in what capacity I know not.I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot... Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us.\n\nThere is something I must return to Malenia. The will that was once her own. The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. The pride she abandoned,\u00a0to meet Radahn's measure.\n\nThere are four more demigods yet to be located. Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed. His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman.\n\nAhh, so the secret medallion led you to the land of the Haligtree?\u00a0I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill.Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely.\u00a0But...with the Haligtree as it is... I suppose Miquella must already be...\n\nAh, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.\u00a0The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:A secret rite known only to me.\u00a0You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.",

    "body": "Godwyn the Golden is a background character in Elden Ring. He was a demigod and the son of Queen Marika the Eternal and Godfrey the First Elden Lord, making him a member of the royal Golden Lineage. In the Night of the Black Knives, he was assassinated by Black Knife Assassins\u00a0with the use of daggers imbued with the Rune of Death, stolen from Maliketh, the Black Blade. His death would precipitate the Shattering, a war between the demigods which would be responsible for much of the current state of the Lands Between.\n\nThe rune of death was stolen. And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden.\n\nGodwyn was a scion of the so-called \"Golden Line\", of which Godrick the Grafted was the final descendant. Early in his mother's divine reign, the Erdtree came under assault by the Ancient Dragons, who had ruled the world before Marika's ascent. The forces of the Erdtree managed to triumph against the ancient dragons, with Godwyn prevailing against the dreaded Fortissax, earning the mighty dragon's friendship in the process and beginning the ancient dragon cult in Leyndell.\n\nSeeking to be free from her fate as a pawn of the Greater Will, Godwyn's half-sister Lunar Princess Ranni stole a fragment of the rune of death, imbuing the weapons of Numen assassins with the rune. Ranni wished to shed her Empyrean body but preserve her spirit, which meant that someone else's spirit would need to die.\u00a0 Nevertheless, when the assassins fell upon the Royal Capital and murdered Godwyn, his soul was destroyed and left only his soulless body behind. He was the first demigod in history to die since the ascension of Marika to the throne of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn's death would be the catalyst for the Shattering of the Elden Ring, plunging the kingdom into chaos without the guidance of the Greater Will. Due to Ranni's ritual, Godwyn's flesh was branded with half of the Cursemark of Death\u00a0and he became the first of Those Who Live in Death. His body was laid to rest deep in the roots of the Erdtree, but it would eventually corrupt it, leading Deathroot to sprout across the Lands Between, causing others to also rise in undeath. These undead worshipped Godwyn as the Prince of Death, believing he would eventually return and lead them. An aspect of Godwyn's corpse appeared in the depths of Stormveil Castle and is responsible for the loss of Rogier's legs. Many figures, including his half-brother Miquella and his companion Fortissax, tried to cure him of his condition and allow him a proper death (see Golden Epitaph), but to no avail. Fortissax would also become corrupted because of his failure to defeat the Death within Godwyn (see Remembrance of the Lichdragon).\n\nThe deathbed companion Fia would become a leading figure among Those Who Live in Death, eventually making her way to Godwyn's corpse. Having received the other half of the cursemark from Ranni's discarded body with help of the Tarnished, Fia lay with Godwyn to grant him a second life as the Prince of Death. As a result of their union, Fia conceived a rune, which a\u00a0Tarnished seeking to become Elden Lord might use to mend the Elden Ring, reimbuing the principle of death within the Golden Order.\n\nA sword made to commemorate the death of Godwyn the Golden, first of the demigods to die.\n\nInfused with the humble prayer of a young boy; \"O brother, lord brother, please die a true death.\"\n\nCursemark carved into the discarded flesh of Ranni the Witch.\u00a0Also known as the half-wheel wound of the centipede.\n\nThis cursemark was carved at the moment of Death of the first demigod,\u00a0and should have taken the shape of a circle.\n\nHowever, two demigods perished at the same time,\u00a0breaking the cursemark into two half-wheels.\n\nRanni was the first of the demigods whose flesh perished,\u00a0while the Prince of Death perished in soul alone.\n\nRemembrance of Lichdragon Fortissax, hewn into the Erdtree.\n\nThe power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.\u00a0Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.\n\nAfter Godwyn the Golden became the Prince of Death, the ancient dragon fought long and hard against\u00a0the Death within its companion. Alas, victory was never achieved and its only reward was corruption.\n\nIncantation that channels the power of the ancient dragon\u00a0Fortissax, now corrupted by Death.Strikes surroundings with a storm of Death lightning.\u00a0Inflicts Death blight upon foes.\u00a0Charging extends duration of the storm.It is said that this golden lightning was wielded by Godwyn, who\u00a0befriended Fortissax.\n\nOne of the incantations of the capital's ancient dragon cult. Summons a lightning spear and hurls it before the caster.Charging causes a lightning bolt to strike the point of impact.Long ago, Godwyn the Golden defeated the ancient dragon Fortissax, and befriended his fallen foe \u2014 an event that gave rise to the ancient dragon cult in the capital.\n\nDagger once belonging to one of the assassins who murdered Godwyn the Golden on the Night of the Black Knives.\n\nA ritual performed on the oddly misshapen blade imbued it with the power of the stolen Rune of Death.\n\nA fetid pustule taken from facial flesh. Raises vitality.\n\nIt is said that\u00a0this\u00a0pustule came from the visage of the Prince of Death, he who used to be called Godwyn. As First Dead of the demigods, it's said he's buried deep under the capital, at the Erdtree's roots.\n\nA fetid, overgrown cyst taken from facial flesh.\u00a0Greatly raises vitality.\n\nIt is said that this cyst came from the corrupted visage of one unable to die a true Death. Indeed, it comes from the Prince of Death, scion of the golden bough and First of the Dead among the demigods.\n\nSet the lusterless sun ablaze with the Prince of Death's flames, inflicting the death ailment upon foes.\n\nFollow up with an additional input to bring down the armament, triggering an explosion.\n\nGolden armor of the Death Knights, adorned with an antiquated depiction of the Erdtree. Enhances skills and incantations of the capital's ancient dragon cult.\n\nThese knights, once Godwyn's personal guard, quested to find their transfigured master's cadaver surrogate\u2014for the coming age of the Duskborn.\n\nA long-hafted golden axe wielded by the Death Knight. Bears a representation of a decayed golden ring. Crackles with lightning, the power of the capital's ancient dragon cult.\n\nThe knight, once the personal guard of Godwyn, was also the protector of the Prince of Death's cadaver surrogate.\n\nA medallion with crimson amber inlaid. Boosts maximum HP by the utmost.\n\nThe Erdtree's old sap becomes amber, treasured as the most precious of jewels in the age of Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.\n\nThese medallions, of the largest variety, were conferred to Godwyn's inner circle of distinguished golden knights.\n\nThe misshapen corpse under Stormveil? That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known.\u00a0It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden.\u00a0That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.\n\nOhh...\u00a0Oh, Lord Godwyn...\u00a0Such cruelty, such humiliation...\u00a0My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death. As the first of the demigods to die. As a martyr to Destined Death. But why must it yet bring such disgrace? A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death...\n\nWhen Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh. But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede. And I must find it. Before the time comes we receive our Lord. My hands will be dirtied once more by the deed. Will you still let me hold you, even then?\n\nThis...is the other hallowbrand. How did you... Oh, my utmost thanks. With this, Godwyn can take his rightful place as First of the Dead. And claim a second, illustrious life. You are my-- our true champion. And though I can't be of any use to you... Can I hold you tight, if only for a moment?\n\nI will soon lay with Godwyn. And it will surely stir within me. The new life of the golden prince, and first Dead of the demigods, as the rune of Those Who Live in Death. Please, do one thing for me. Brandish this child, my rune, and take for yourself the throne. Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death. By becoming our Elden Lord.",

    "body": "The Greater Will\u00a0is an otherworldly force in\u00a0Elden Ring\u00a0that has had a pivotal role in shaping the events\u00a0of the Lands Between. Its envoys are the Two Fingers and it speaks through them using a language of light. While this does mean much of the Two Fingers actions and words can be attributed to the Greater Will, there are those who accuse the Fingers of long being broken or abandoned. The Greater Will behaves in counter to the\u00a0Outer Gods\u00a0as it is responsible for creating all life, and is instead likened to a cosmic entity that dwells in a lightless abyss.\n\nBut here we are... The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will.\" - Enia\n\nThe\u00a0first action of the Greater Will is told by Hyetta upon completion of her quest and inheriting the Flame of Frenzy. She\u00a0recounts on behalf of the Three Fingers\u00a0that \"All that there is came from the One Great\" and that it was split in order to create fractures, births, and souls. She insists that the Greater Will made a mistake, implying it was the reason that the One Great split apart. It should be noted that like Shabriri, she is not exactly a reliable narrator, and frames things in a way to paint the Frenzied Flame in a positive light. The Greater Will was likely not mistaken in splitting the One Great apart, and may be the reason the Lands Between and its inhabitants exist in the first place. The Greater Will speaks through the Two Fingers\u00a0which are the product of Metyr, Mother of Fingers, who is the daughter of the Greater Will and the first shooting star to fall upon the Lands Between. The Two Fingers do not speak in the traditional sense, and require special Finger Readers to interpret their words. At some point, the Greater Will sent a golden star to the Lands Between that would become the governing power of the land known as the Elden Ring, and along with it sent a beast that was the living concept of Order, the Elden Beast.\u00a0The Two Fingers, acting on behalf of the Greater Will, would\u00a0recognize many candidates as\u00a0Empyreans\u00a0who could ascend to godhood and bear the Elden Ring.\u00a0Queen Marika\u00a0was one such figure, and according to the\u00a0Crimson Seed Talisman +1, the Two Fingers would assist her in creating the\u00a0Erdtree. After Queen Marika and\u00a0Godfrey, First Elden Lord\u00a0came into power and began a new age, the Two Fingers and the Greater Will became prominent figures in the religious practices of\u00a0Leyndell, Royal Capital\u00a0and other regions under the control of the Golden Order.\u00a0Even churches outside the Lands Between sent out\u00a0confessors\u00a0that would hunt down and quietly dispose of the Two Fingers' enemies.\n\nThe hat of Count Ymir, High Priest. The circular design at the top represents the Greater Will and its lightless abyss, imparting increased intelligence and arcane to the wearer.Though Count Ymir instructed Rellana in the sorcerous arts, he abandoned his allegiance to the moon.\n\n\"It was merely the closest of the celestial bodies. Nothing more.\"\n\nWhile the Greater Will desired Order for those that followed its teachings, it also punished those that sought it harm.\u00a0Long ago, the Nox, or people of the Eternal Cities (Nokron, Nokstella, Nameless), invoked the ire of the Greater Will, and were banished deep underground. Now they live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. The Nox would wear Mirrorhelms to reflect light and ward off the intervention of the Greater Will and its vassal Fingers who use light to communicate. War Counselor Iji would also do this as he planned treachery against the Fingers. The Nox's greatest act of treason was creating the Fingerslayer Blade, which could harm the Two Fingers and by extension the Greater Will. Given the Fingerslayer Blade still lies in Nokron, the Eternal City, it seems the Nox conspired against the Greater Will long after their initial punishment and were so subject to\u00a0further tragedy. Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, assailed one of the Eternal Cities and took away its night sky. This sky appears to decorate Astel's boss arena, and the city in question appears to be the Nameless one in Deeproot Depths which lacks a night sky and lies in relative ruin.\u00a0While not much is known about the nature of Astel,\u00a0Malformed Stars, or the\u00a0fallingstar beasts, the home of the fallingstar beasts is referred to as the lightless dark far beyond in the Gravitational Missile description. This verbiage is also used for Count Ymir's High Priest Hat which describes the Greater Will and its lightless abyss.\n\nOne trait that is continuously associated with the Greater Will is that of abandonment. When and why this occurs is not exactly made clear and thus some extrapolations are made. We are first told this in the game's opening monologue that \"Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring known as the Great Runes, and the mad taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering. A war that meant abandonment by the Greater Will\". While the Greater Will does not seem to care about how Order is maintained or Marika's actions prior, it is the war of the Shattering itself that causes the Greater Will to\u00a0renounce the demigods. Enia makes it clear that\u00a0the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it, and has instead only tasked the tarnished to eliminate the demigods and mend the Elden Ring as relayed to by the Two Fingers.\u00a0Perhaps it is the demigods' inability to maintain Order that led to the Greater Will and the Two Fingers turning against them. However, the validity of Enia and the Two Fingers is called into question by a number of characters including Varre, who says \"the words of the Two Fingers cannot be trusted. Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions. I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed. Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind. That's the part that irks the most.\", Sir Gideon\u00a0who according to the Lord's Divine Fortification\u00a0description, discovered that the Two Fingers were broken long ago, and Count Ymir who says \"that Marika, and the fingers that guided her, were unsound from the start. Well, the truth lies deeper still. It is their mother who is damaged and unhinged\". Indeed, according to the Staff of the Great Beyond description, Metyr was left abandoned and broken, what does that say about her offspring, the Two Fingers?\n\nOne of the weapons originating from the Two Fingers. A formless sequence of ciphers comprise its blade, and as such no shield can repel it. Deals holy damage.\n\nThe furtive inscription appears to hang in the air; the language of light spoken by the Two Fingers.\n\nRemembrance of the Elden Beast, hewn into the Erdtree.\n\nThe power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.\u00a0Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.\n\nIt was the vassal beast of the Greater Will and living incarnation of the concept of Order.\n\nThis legendary incantation is the most ancient of those that derive from the Erdtree.\n\nCreates a stream of golden shooting stars that assail the area.\n\nIt is said that long ago, the Greater Will sent a golden star bearing a beast into the Lands Between, which would later become the Elden Ring.\n\nHelm fashioned from a crystal looking-glass. One among the Eternal City's ritual implements. Easily broken and weak against striking attacks.\n\nWorn by those committed to high treason, it wards off the intervention of the Greater Will and its vassal Fingers.\n\nLong ago, the Nox invoked the ire of the Greater Will, and were banished deep underground. Now they live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. Of the coming age of the stars. And their Lord of Night.\n\nThe hidden treasure of the Eternal City of Nokron; a blade said to have been born of a corpse.\n\nThis blood-drenched fetish is proof of the high treason committed by the Eternal City and symbolizes its downfall.\n\nCannot be wielded by those without a fate, but is said to be able to harm the Greater Will and its vassals.\n\nRemembrance of Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, hewn into the Erdtree.\n\nThe power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.\u00a0Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.\n\nA malformed star born in the flightless void far away. Once destroyed an Eternal City and took away their sky. A falling star of ill omen.\n\nOne of the glintstone sorceries that manipulates gravitational forces.\n\nSummons a void that emits a hail of meteorites.\u00a0Hold to continue the effect.\n\nA manifestation of the power with which Astel leveled the Eternal City.\n\nSword fashioned from a delicate wing, suffused with the magic of\u00a0the stars.Strong attack unleashes a wave of enchanted light.\n\nCrafted from a relic of the Naturalborn of the Void who is said to\u00a0have assailed the Eternal City.\n\nOne of the glintstone sorceries that manipulates gravitational forces.\n\nFires a gravitational projectile that pulls in enemies before finally exploding.\u00a0Charging extends reach of projectile and number of inward pulls.\n\nSaid to have originated in the lightless dark far beyond\u2014the home of the fallingstar beasts.\n\nRemembrance of Metyr, the Mother of Fingers, hewn into the Scadutree.\n\nThe power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.\n\nThe mother of all Two Fingers and Fingercreepers was in turn a magnificently gleaming daughter of the Greater Will, and the first shooting star to fall upon the Lands Between.\n\nStaff fashioned from the tail-fingers of Metyr, the Mother of Fingers, and the microcosm raised aloft over the crux they form.\n\nCatalyst for casting both sorceries and incantations.\n\nThe Mother received signs from the Greater Will from the beyond of the microcosm. Despite being broken and abandoned, she kept waiting for another message to come.\n\nRise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the\u00a0Elden Ring\u00a0and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between.\n\nIn the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal, the\u00a0Elden Ring, the source of the Erdtree, has been shattered.\n\nMarika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the\u00a0Elden Ring\u00a0known as the Great Runes, and the mad taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering.\n\nI interpret the words of the Fingers,\u00a0envoys to the Greater Will.\n\nAcross the realm, life lies in ruin. Fallen to pieces. Foul curses and misery spread, unabating.\u00a0But the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it.\n\nThe Greater Will has long renounced the demigods. Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left.\n\nOnly once before have I seen two Great Runes together. Look there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance.\u00a0Fine work, brave Tarnished. The Greater Will is pleased.\n\nShaken by this turn of events, they are busy consulting the Greater Will. When they are finished, the Fingers will once again offer their guidance. But thousands, if not tens of thousands, of moons must first pass.\n\nThe Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will. ... But here we are... The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will. The realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers. Who is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever?\n\nI, too, am a glintstone sorcerer. We study the stars, and examine the life therein. Are you familiar with our findings? Long ago, we began as stardust, born of a great rupture far across the skies. We, too, are children of the Greater Will. Is that not divine? Is that not sublime? ...and yet, none can fathom its implications, its utter brilliance!\n\nI fear that you have borne witness to the whole of it. The conceits \u2013 the hypocrisy \u2013 of the world built upon the Erdtree. The follies of men. Their bitter suffering. Is there no hope for redemption? The answer, sadly, is clear. There never was any hope. They were each of them defective. Unhinged, from the start. Marika herself. And the fingers that guided her. And this is what troubles me. No matter our efforts, if the roots are rotten, \u2026then we have little recourse.",

    "body": "Submit your theories and reasoning, or feel free to debate why I'm wrong. I consider this to be the most likely answer, simply because I find that it makes the most sense and there is more reasoning and links to this conclusion than any other theory I have read (and I have read a lot). I also believe this is why we didn't really get any GEQ lore in the DLC, because there is plenty of evidence in the base game. I would be very happy to be proven wrong and to hear a better theory. \n\n\n\n**Who is the Gloam Eyed Queen (The Queen in Black)?**  \nMarika, and by extension, Melina, who is an offshoot/daughter/reincarnation of Marika.\n\n**When on the timeline did the \"God Hunt\" occur?**   \nShortly before Marika became \"Marika the Eternal\".\n\n**What God/s was hunted?**  \nThe Fell God, spread across the Trolls. The Trolls were skinned and the Fell God was cut out of the Trolls abdomen and replaced with a tablet, which likely contains magical properties that can ward off the Fell Gods influence. The trolls that are not skinned are those who originally betrayed the Fell God and the Fire Giants, and joined Marika and Godfrey's forces during the war. Now they remain as guards to the Forge of the Giants.\n\n**Why did she do this?**  \nOn top of the fact that they were a huge threat to her in general, it is stated that the Fell God also \"*haunts the sagas of the Hornsent*\". We know that Marika had some kind of alliance with the Hornsent, likely because she needed access to the Gate of Divinity. What better way to gain their trust than defeating an enemy that has haunted them for generations.\n\n**How did she do this?**  \nEven before becoming a God, Marika had already amassed great power and many allies. She was also an Empyrean, meaning she had direct ties to Metyr.\n\n**The elephant in the room, Malekith, and why he would have \"defeated\" her.**  \n*\"Marika's sole need of her shadow was a vessel to lock away Destined Death. Even then, she betrayed him.\".* This explains it all since it's well known that Marika wanted to remove death all together. She planned for Malekith to defeat her and seal away Destined Death once she had finished using it's power. She used him, and that is how she betray him.\n\n\n\n**My reasoning and \"evidence\" (I'll try to organise it):**\n\n* The Godskin weapons are large, and that is even made clear in their item description. This likely means that they were used for skinning large creatures, such as the Trolls.\n* The Godskins have \"assimilated\" inhuman physiology, similar to that of the crucible. Assimilate is an interesting word to have been used, meaning that they took in these traits from somewhere. The Furnace Visage depicts the Fell God surrounded in horns, directly linking it to the crucible.\n* Trolls, which are descended from Giants, all have the front of their abdomens carved out. This is the same location where the Fell God sits on the Fire Giant we face. All the trolls, except for those found in the mountain tops, appear to be flayed. The natural skin colour of the Trolls also appears to be white, matching that of the Godskins attire.\n* The Noble Presence incantation mirrors that of the roar of the Trolls and the eruption attack move during the 2nd phase of the Fire Giant. It's description states: \"*Once a sign of the gods' wrath, this incantation became a trophy\u00a0of the Nobles' god hunt.*\"\n* The Godskins Noble Robe has 7 faces in a circle with a sigil at the bottom that looks an awful lot like Metyr, and another symbol in the center. This pattern is the same as the Fell Gods Eye, eight circles surrounding a center circle.\n* The Trolls have golden/yellow eyes, the same as the faces on the Godskin Noble Robes. The Trolls face even share a similar all-round tentacle like feature to these faces.\n* The Furnace Visage is said to depict the Fell God, but the Fell God typically has only one eye. This makes sense though if the Furnace Visage is actually depicting the face of a Troll, which is similar in design.\n* The Godslayer's Seal and the sigil for Black Flame Incantations look a lot like Metyrs head.\n* Blackflame Monk Amon is said to have fled from the Giants Flame when he swore fealty to the Black Flame. Why turn to the Black Flame? Why make this connection between the Fell God/Fire Monks and the Black Flame/GEQ?\n* It is specifically stated that the Fell God was said to have been slain by Marika.\n* The cave where we find the Godskin Swaddling Cloth is right near where the Battle against the Giants took place, and the First Church of Marika.\n* It is stated that the Age of the Erdtree began right after the war against the giants when the Trolls betrayed and fire was vanquished. It makes sense that this happened, Marika gained the trust of the Hornsent and got access to the Gate of Divinity, allowing her to become a God, Marika the Eternal.\n* The frenzied trolls in the snowfields are likely Trolls who managed to escape or were set loose because they were afflicted by frenzy due to the trauma they went through.\n* The trolls with Fur in the mountain tops have fur and guard the forge because they are the Trolls that betray the giants and joined with Marika. People say that they have fur \"because it's cold\". I know it's a game, but evolution doesn't just happen like that, and the other trolls are very clearly skinned/flayed and are not just simply missing their fur.\n* There are only 2-3 trolls in the Shadow of the Erdtree, likely because Marika removed them as part of her plan to gain the trust of the Hornsent.\n* How could Marika have gotten away with all this? Marika is already known to have rewritten the history books and hide her own past. People in the Lands Between know these events happened, but her name has just been removed and replaced with the Gloam Eyed Queen.\n* Rykard speaks \"blasphemy\", likely about Marika's past. There are a lot of dead trolls on the Road to Iniquity that have likely been tortured and interrogated for information, but there is a single Frenzied Troll right outside Volcano Manor. I would guess that this Troll was tortured and revealed the truth about Marika to Rykard and his Inquisitors before succumbing to frenzy and going mad.\n\n\n\nHope you enjoyed",

The one I usually bring up is that Maliketh canonically defeats the GEQ *before* the Rune of Death is sealed, which is linked to the creation of the Golden Order. Which means that, if Marika is the GEQ, *Marika* would have had to have been \"defeated\" for basically her entire reign as Marika the Eternal. Which obviously doesn't make any sense.\n\nAs for \"submitting my own theory\":\n\n&gt;Who is the Gloam Eyed Queen?\n\nAn otherwise unnamed character, who we never learn about or interact with in any context other than her being the GEQ.

I actually find this to be extremely straightforward even though \"Was Radahn charmed?\" and the nature of Miquella's charming ability have been hotly argued as topics.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID, there are still questions:\n\n* Leda and Dane don't need the charm to be loyal to Miquella, but are affected regardless to make them accepting of the others in the party.  Miquella compelling the vow does not necessarily mean it was entirely against Radahn's wishes.\n* Does Miquella have total control over his ability to compel affection such that it is always a purposeful act, or can it happen inadvertently?\n* **Miquella compelled a promise for an act, not the act itself, which opens the door to all sorts of possibilities, including Radahn trying things to circumvent it.**\n\nRandom related questions:\n\n* Radahn and Jerren made oaths to each other for honorable deaths.  Why was that needed if he already had one with Miquella/Malenia?\n* If Radahn expected to become Miquella's Lord, why did he siege Leyndell and challenge Morgott as part of the Shattering War, something only an aspiring Lord of Marika would need to do?\n* If Radahn is satisfied by his honorable end, why is he ok with being dragged back?\n* Why would Radahn, a man obsessed with war and honorable combat, be interested in lording over an Age of Compassion?\n\nAnsbach is so convinced by the idea that Radahn wouldn't want to return that he assumes it would convince Freyja to side with him in stopping the ritual. But she is too obsessed with Radahn's warlike persona to understand the true implications and is only excited that Radahn can return and keep fighting. Totally oblivious to the fact that the Age he is returning for is to be one lacking merit-based stature and lessened/no conflict. Ansbach only laughs at how stupid Freyja is.\n\nEDIT: Our boy Ansbach would never call someone stupid, and pedantic people have taken issue with my wording.  He's saying he thought she would act a certain way based on provided information and then did the opposite, which is both amusing to him but also sort of expected.  Which some might concisely call 'being stupid'.\n\ntl;dr There are major inconsistencies to this story and what we know about Radahn, I believe it is reasonable to conclude that the vow was against his wishes.",

The Night of Black Knives was designed not merely to kill the scions of the golden lineage, but to resurrect them as Lords for a new Age of Night, with Godwyn as the crucial element.\n\nI believe the Night of Black Knives was a failed three-way ritual. Godwyn's aim was to become a god, specifically a Dragon Lord. According to the 'sacred scroll rites,' this transformation requires the prospective god to die and then be reborn into a new vessel. Godwyn was likely attempting to be reborn in the vessel of a dragon to achieve this Lordship.\n\nThe Nox, using their silver tear experiments, were attempting to create a Lord by crafting flexible vessels capable of absorbing stray souls, one of which might become strong enough for the role. (There\u2019s a controversial theory that suggests Godwyn is a mimic; I disagree, but I do believe some mimic tears were created to potentially house Godwyn's soul.)\n\nGodwyn, I believe, intended to die regardless, pursuing his own agenda. This was separate from the Nox's goals and Ranni's goals. The Nox thwarted Godwyn's plans, only to have their own plans subsequently foiled by Ranni, who was likely allied with the Nox before she acted against them.\n\nThis plot may have involved most of the Carians, including Radagon, as eliminating much of the Golden Lineage would have significantly elevated the status of the Carian children and, by extension, Radagon himself.",

All three, in their second line, state 'Used to restore the fractured elden ring when brandished by the elden lord.' At the end of the game, when you get access to the elden ring, you brandish it, you hold it up and potentially have the ability to change it. In Marika's spoken echo, she's telling godfrey and his men to do certain things before brandishing the elden ring. This implies they don't have access to the elden ring yet. If marika already had the ring, they could brandish it then and there. Defeating the giants and gaining access to the forge could have enabled godfrey to use the same warp gate to farum azula that the player uses in-game. I think when godfrey defeated placidusax he brought the elden ring back to marika and she ate it.",

Who were these Gods and what can we learn about them? \n\nOf all the dialogue concerning Gods in game there is one group who stands out specifically. The Oracle Envoys.\n\n\"Spirits of a monstrous band of musicians who employ sacred arts. It is said that when Oracle Envoys appear, playing their pipes, they do so to herald the arrival of a new god, or age.\"\n~ Oracle Envoy Ashes\n\nThey're specifically mentioned as heralds of new Gods, their ages and presumably their orders. If that is the case that means that they've been around for a LOOOOOOOOONG time, and if so that means that they no doubt would have some at least extant connections to the Godskins.\n\nLo and behold there exists an item which might explain the nature of the Gods in question.\n\n\"Thin strips of flesh taken from a bloodless creature.\"\n~ Strips of White Flesh\n\nThis item specifically is dropped by the Oracle Envoys who themselves seem to have a quite ivory palor. \n\nSo essentially what does that tell us? A couple things actually. The best item of reference to compare it would be its counterpart the Sliver of Meat item.\n\n\"A slice of thinly carved beast flesh.\"\n~ Sliver of Meat\n\nIf we go based off my theory this would establish the Gods in question as:\n\n- White Skinned\n- Bloodless\n- And non-beast\n\nThe last part I assume based not only off of the description but the types of enemies that drop the Strips of White Flesh item.\n\nIf you look at the wiki collectively the common vein amongst most of its carriers are aquatic creatures such as crabs and lobsters. To me this indicates that these Gods may have had origins that lay in the water.\n\nAnother vein of thought that supports this is the mention of an alternative evolutionary process mentioned in the Godskin gear:\n\n\"Nobles are the most ancient apostles\nwho are said to have assimilated inhuman physiology.\"\n~ Godskin Noble Robe\n\nThe assimilation of inhuman physiology is what grabs me here. It might even imply that the Gods they hunted evolved based off an alternative to the Crucible, and the Crucibles creation may have been a more recent occurrence. This is also supported considering that the Godskins were known for borrowing other things from the Gods they hunted as well:\n\n\"Once a sign of the gods' wrath, this incantation became a trophy of the Nobles' god hunt.\"\n~ Noble Presence\n\nIt's quite possible that the Godskins white skin itself came about as a result of their hunt.\n\nI'd love to know everyone's thoughts!

Some of their attacks appear to do holy damage as well, although I'm not certain of that.\n\nThe expedition description reads:\n\n\"Seven valkyries clad in white armor. These servants of the heavens restore the balance of the world by wielding heroic weapons that purify chaos.\n\nBut even heroines must one day sleep, so why not retire early to the annals of history?\"\n\n  \nThe use of weapons, of course, typically involves death, even when it's for a noble cause. I know that \"of the heavens\" could set them apart from the concept of \"death's gentle envoys\", but I would like to point out that Maliketh's Black Blade (the weapon and the incantation), and the Black Knife weapons do holy damage, and things related to Black Flame scale on Faith.\n\nAnd the description in the relic received for defeating them reads:\n\n&gt;!A tiny farming village was besieged by bandits, who proceeded to ravage both its plots and people.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!A young village girl, seeking help, dashed into the forest, where she prayed to the statue of a protective deity that held a weapon raised overhead.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!By the end the village was steeped in red and settled in silence.

Radagon does strike a pose like this in the intro to his boss fight, but not in his statues.\n\n  \nI understand that the nature of Nightreign's canon is shaky, but the Winged Scythe's description has always felt like a bit of an odd inclusion in Elden Ring, and this kind of lore expansion seems like a perfect fit for Nightreign. The game's director has more or less said directly that it's designed to exist in Elden Ring's world without unraveling its central plot and mysteries. I'm curious what others think though.",

Malenia herself, and her \" children\", have the term \" scarlet valkyrie\" applied to them, and Malenia's own getup(specifically  her helm) seems to point to the intent of wanting to appear as one of those maidens, or at least follow their example.\n\nIt's not that complicated. Valkyries are frequently winged women in Norse mythology who serve and fight with Odin appear to guide warriors unto a glorious afterlife(Valhalla) as their reward. \"Death's gentle envoys\" are valkyries based on their description.

The Cleanrot Knights have white wings on their helm, and Miquella and Malenia have many ties to ancient death culture. I think the most illuminating tie comes from the Death Ritual Spear and the Spectral Rings of Light. The Spectral Rings of Light of course look like a prototype of Miquella\u2019s light with their age being quite apparently older than Miquella\u2019s Unalloyed.

    "body": "The Maiden featured on the Shield of the Guilty seems to reveal a bit about the nature of the Lands Between and it's existence as a possible Penal Colony.\n\nThe shield description reads...\n\n\"Shield made to venerate a maiden whose eyes were crushed by Briars of Sin before being reborn in these lands.\n\nVenerating the repose of the soul, this shield boosts focus. The briars can be used to attack foes.\"\n\nRight away we are given several subjects...\n\n- The Briars of Sin\n- Rebirth\n- Repose of the Soul\n\nWhat does this tell us? Well essentially it seems that the Briar Maiden was guilty of something as Briars of Sin reveals:\n\n\"The guilty, their eyes gouged by thorns, lived in eternal darkness. There, they discovered the blood star.\"\n\nThis tells us right away that the Briar Maiden was guilty of something. For this she had her eyes crushed by deadly briars and was forced to walk in Eternal Darkness for her punishment. \n\nThe presence of Briars also possibly implies a strong connection to the Blood Star, and by possible extension the Mother of Truth.\n\nAside from her these thorns are featured on the Fire Guardian Hags likely signifying some connection between these two parties. In essence it begs the question of what are these hags guilty of if they are in-service to the Erdtree. A service that would ensure the trees longevity at that.\n\nAnother possessor of Briars is Elemer, another foreigner who himself was set to be Executed if it weren't for the downfall of House Marais. His gear reads:\n\n\"Battered iron armor from a foreign land. Worn by Elemer of the Briar. \n\nThe winding, rusted iron briars are a mark of the guilty and typically indicate a sentence of death.\n\nElemer murdered numerous instructors and merchants, and was known as the Bell Bearing Hunter.\"\n\n~ Briar Armor\n\nAgain we are given the subjects of Guilt and foreign nature. Elemer originates from Eochaid and for whatever reason he was sent ALL THE WAY to TLB to be killed. Why? \n\nThat brings us to our next subjects: Rebirth and Repose of the Soul.\n\nWhy The Lands Between, ignoring differences between real world and fictional economies, wouldn't it cost less to just kill them where they were? Perhaps but what if I told you that they were only meant to die to be reborn. If we take another look at the Shield of the Guilty it mentions:\n\n\"Shield made to venerate a maiden whose eyes were crushed by Briars of Sin before being reborn in these lands.\"\n\nTo be reborn requires that one must have died, even in the metaphorical sense, something must be given up to gain new shape. And it's not like this isn't something that happens regularly in TLB anyways:\n\n\"Amber egg clutched by Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon.\nGreat Rune of unborn demigods.\n\nPerfects those who have been born anew.\n\nChildren born anew by Rennala are all frail and short-lived. Imperfect beings, each and all.\"\n\nIn fact we see a myriad of enemies in game that have seemingly been reborn into new shapes, and each of them drops a Larval Tear. In order for this rebirth to be reversed the creatures new form in question must be destroyed to revert. This loosely connects Death with transformation (though then again it could just be a gameplay mech who knows?)\n\nBut lastly to tie this together are the Lulling Branch and the Slumbering Egg:\n\n\"In the midst of drowsiness, there is the will to awaken.\nFeelings that rise from the depths of one's heart.\"\n\n\"Owl eggs that will never hatch.\nMaterial used for crafting items.\n\nPrized as a symbol of the most sublime slumber.\"\n\nIn previous posts I detail how Sleep the domain of St. Trina has intrinsic connections to Death which is countered by Miquella's connection to \"waking,\" birth or what we collectively reference as Nascency.\n\nBoth operate as vital parts of the cycle of rebirth one bringing rest to that which whithers, while the other rouses new life into birth.\n\nThe line mentioned on the shield:\n\n\"Venerating the repose of the soul\"\n\nSeems to be referencing directly the subject mentioned prior in the same item: the concept of being reborn.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nI have come to believe that The Lands Between are indeed a Penal Colony, and that Death only washes ashore to be reborn in some way into a more suitable acceptable form. This would even seem to explain the Zealotry of the Hornsent who Jar the Maidens.\n\nIf indeed there was some history here wherein the Shaman would, \"Make Saints of Criminals\" who came there, we can kinda see how it could turn for the worst if perhaps a previous order had been deposed.\n\nTo put it concisely: The Shaman were likely Wardens of a Penal Colony, and could have suffered a disaster which tilted the scales out of their favor making the prison (rehabilitation center?) they once held into cage for themselves. \n\nTo back this up I'll even bring up the Winged Scythe:\n\n\"According to pagan belief, white-winged maidens are said to be Death's gentle envoys.\"\n\nThe Deathbirds were no doubt Matriarchal given that their only progenitor given was a Mother in the Form of the Twinbirds. And here we are again given the concept of femininity in connection with Death. The Deathbed companions, Trina, Melina, Ranni and even Malenia and her Valkyries. \n\nThis paints a picture of a Matriarchal Land of Death and if one has Death, it must be tempered and defined by Life. The line connecting these two? Rebirth. \n\nBonus bit:\n\nThis got me to thinking also about the Biblical Story of Cain and Abel. To keep it short, after Cain kills his Brother he is sent to \"The Land of Nod,\" and if one where to look up the meaning of the word Numen/Numina:\n\n\"Etymologically, the word means \"a nod of the head\", here referring to a deity as it were \"nodding\", or making its will or its presence known.\"\n\nJust some food for thought. I hope you enjoyed my ramblings, please lmk what you think! And as always HAPPY LORE HUNTING!!!",

She wielded the power of flame (like her brother messmer) and infused it with the power of destined death to create her weapon she could use to defeat her mother. The Godslaying Black Flame. (This also tracks with how each of the Demigods claimed a great rune from the Elden Ring. The \u201cGreat Rune\u201d of the Gloam Eyed Queen was the Rune of Death) \n\nUltimately Melina met her end as the Gloam Eyed Queen when she was defeated by Maliketh of the Black Blade, Marikas shadow. (This also would give further cause for why the Demigods all feared Maliketh) \n\nHowever, even though Maliketh killed her she did not die, because upon her defeat her mother Queen Marika removed the rune of death from the Elden Ring. And Maliketh then sealed the rune inside his blade. Thus her body died but yet she lives burned and bodiless. ( My own theory is that at this time she remained dormant in the form of a rememberance)\n\nFast forward to the shattering. Marika is now held captive inside the Erdtree by the Greater Will as punishment for shattering the Elden Ring.\n\nMarika knows that only \u201cones who envision Flame\u201d have the power to burn the erdtree and thus gain access to where she is. (As confirmed by Finger Reader Enia)\n\nFrom inside the Erdtree she uses the remembrance of the Gloam Eyed Queen her daughter, to resurrect her as Melina. And tasks her with the role of serving as the Kindling Maiden and aiding the tarnished who would be Lord. \n\n(I think it also might be possible to say she is a special type of spirit ash summon that Marika created from the Gloam Eyed Queen remains)\n\nFast forward to Frenzied Flame ending. Now that the Rune of death has been unsealed by the Tarnished. Her power she wielded as the Gloam Eyed Queen has now also been unsealed as well. \nAnd we see her transformed.\n\nThe reason Melina eye was always closed before was because it held a remnant of the power of destined death. The mark over her eye I believe represented a shard of the Rune of Death. \n\nNow the rune of death is unleashed and the power of Destined death that was sealed in her eye (or perhaps the ability to control Destined Death) has been unleashed with it.\n\nThus the Gloam Eyed Queen is reborn. \n\n\n\n",

Nightreign is about our characters' journey through the Eclipse rebirth ritual, a ritual about returning memory after death, because in Elden Ring's world (and George R.R. Martin's) life == memory. \n\n1. The Nightring looks like a partial solar eclipse, the stage of the solar eclipse with the \"diamond ring\" effect\n2. The Eclipse is a symbol of rebirth \n3. The Eclipse rebirth ritual is about returning memories, and in Elden Ring memory = life\n4. Our Nightfarers are on a journey of regaining memories --&gt; this world is within the eclipse\n5. The Nightlord = Night King from Game of Thrones (in NR night erodes memory, NK wants to kill Three-Eyed Raven, the \"memory of the world\")\n6. The PARTIAL solar eclipse is a symbol for DEATH, and death is also symbolized by a black hole\n7. Many people in the Lands Between are performing the Eclipse rebirth ritual using \"soul hard drives\" to remember the dead to rebirth them\n8. Death, Night, Shadow, and the Abyss are all different versions of the \"dark\" \n9. Everything \"dark\" has been labeled \"sin\" and \"sealed away\" \n10. The sealing away of the dark might be the \"sin of the Erdtree\" because dark is a natural part of the world and order and getting rid of half of nature is a big no no\n11. I identify the \"root\" pattern, seen in DeathROOT, the Erdtree Roots, the Dark Souls bonfires, Great Site of Grace, the Grandmother tree,  the Swords of Light &amp; Darkness, and the stone monument on the Erdtree\n12. Marika may have discovered the natural light/dark duality of the root and changed her mind about the dark\n\nThis video is my explanation for Nightreisn's world, the eclipse, death, rebirth, the Dark, and what the son of the Erdtree is. \n\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw3XAuPupks\n\nLet me know your thoughts!!

A recurring concept in Dark Souls is the idea that souls are passed down and that they change.\u00a0 The strongest example is how we see the Lord Souls get passed down and evolve between DS 1 and 3.\n\n\nTypically, sins are something that we think of as attaching to the soul of the sinner.\u00a0 If runes are memories, and memories are souls, and souls can be transferred, then perhaps the \"foundation\" is not deferring responsibility to their progeny. Perhaps the nightfarers are simply the most recent recipients of the remnants of the souls of those who were part of the foundation.",

In fact, the fact that St. Trina never received a Great Rune suggests she may not be regarded a demigod, either, which is strange to consider.\n\nAs far as we know, Ranni has no dual aspect. She has Blaidd, just as Marika has Maliketh, but Shadows are neither demigods nor Empyreans, despite having been created from some aspect of one.

An extreme magical contraception method? Trying to escape the fate like ranni did? \n\nAlso the jarring ritual for me evokes again a theme of forced pregnancy: the imagery itself with women suffering with body horror and other parts that attack you with a pseudo umbilical cord. It makes me think the shaman people- who i think are only women, are the \u201cvehicle\u201d, the vessel, the glue of rebirth. These women have to literally carry and transform souls into \u201csaints\u201d by carrying their fleshy transformation - its a very fucked up allegory to saintly reincarnation but from the perspective of the mothers.\n\nI think marika is naturally a good vessel that could not only make saints but gods too, and so she became the vessel of the elden ring- a God but we know that godhood is a prison and she was now cursed by fate to practically rebirth the gods into her children. \n\nI see this theme in most empyreans we know, Ranni did the ultimate contraception and Malenia is cursed being a vessel of a \u201cmothering\u201d god and a candidate for replacing marika, she even is referred as an unwilling mother who doesnt accept her children (kindred of rot). Miquela is weird and his nascency curse is maybe what stops him from being able to be a literal full grown \u201cmother\u201d empyrean. \n\n\nTldr: i think marika is a life/fertility goddess who really really doesnt want to.",

And GRRM demonstrates time and time again that rulers who just do whatever they want are bad rulers.\n\nMarika has to abandon Messmer (though I think Radagon factors into this one) she has to shackle the Omen, as they are a curse or plague in the eyes of order. Malenia and Miquella are seen as cursed and impure because of the Golden Order. She has to use her children as tools to reforge order because that's her duty as God.

Note that the Weapon Skill for this sword is \"Impaling Thrust\", same as the \"Spear\" that was once used by the Enchanted Knight class in V1.00, though back then, that was known as the \"Winged Spear\" and used \"Charge Forth\" as the base weapon skill.\n* Despite numbering fewer than twenty, this power to wield sorcerous battle skills made them a match for even the champions of gold in battle\n* **Adding this point regarding Troll Knights because I forgot to when I first posted:** *Called into service when the Queen invoked an oath they swore,* *the trolls are treated as true knights of Caria, and fight arm in arm with their human comrades.*\n\nWhile we obviously can never really say whether it was a rule to only have fewer than twenty Carian Knights at any given time, as a broad statement, it begs the question: **how many can we realistically account for?**\n\n# \"Human\" Carian Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #1: Loretta**\n\n* **Quote:** \"Loretta was once a royal Carian Knight and her lapis-lazuli blue cape is the emblem of the knightly pride that continues to guide her\"\n* **Quote:** Undertook a \"long, bloody journey to seek out a place where the Albinaurics could live in peace\" and \"determined that the Haligtree was their best chance for eventual salvation.\"\n* **Quote:** \"It is said that the bow was Loretta's favored weapon.\"\n* **Quote:** Her war sickle is said to have originally \"been given for service as a personal guard to Carian royalty\"\n* **Observation:** She is now a Knight of the Haligtree, loyal to Miquella, with her war sickle's blue glintstone now replaced by unalloyed gold\n* **Observation:** Rumored to be an Albinauric, though the game's text decries this rumor as \"absurd\"\n\n**Carian Knight #2: Moongrum**\n\n* **Observation:** Guards the entrance of the elevator leading up to Rennala at the Raya Lucarian Academy\n* **Observation:** Wields a Carian Knight's Shield (with Carian Retaliation), a Carian Knight's Sword, uses an Academy Glintstone Staff to cast Carian Piercer.\n* **Observation:** The Carian Piercer is a counterpart to the Carian Greatsword sorcery, which itself is said to allow sorcerers to \"gain the strength of knights, their loyalty sworn to the moon.\"\n* **Theory:** While some theorize that Moongrum turned on Rellana and sided with the Academy, the Academy itself seems to be splintered and lacks leadership. My personal belief is that Moongrum is still loyal to Rennala and is found where he is because he's protecting her. His mostly Carian loadout is only contradicted by his choice of staff, which itself is still using a Carian sorcery; it's not a massive leap to guess that he entered the ranks of the Carian Knights when the Carian Royals and the Raya Lucarian Academy were allied.\n\n**Carian Knight #3: Moonrithyll**\n\n* **Observation:** Found at Castle Ensis, guarding the path ultimately leading to Rellana, Twin Moon Knight, Rellana's younger sister, and former Carian Princess\n* **Observation:** Described as \"steadfast\", Moonrithyll was the \"Twin Moon Knight's chamberlain\"\n* **Quote:** \"She was also a friend to the trolls, who served the royal family, and proudly wielded their weapons as she fought arm in arm with her gargantuan comrades\"\n* **Observation:** Rellana's Cameo, found at the altar directly behind where Moonrithyll is fought, speaks of an \"unparalleled devotion of those who left their homelands to serve Rellana.\"\n* **Quote:** The following quote, included in the description of the Cameo, may be attributed to her, given its proximity to where she was found: *'By your leave, we will accompany you wherever your lunar vessel takes you.'*\n* **Theory:** Physically, she appears to be a genderbent version of Moongrum; their common name structure and respective protection of siblings of Carian royalty (former or otherwise) reinforces the notion that, even if they aren't twins, they may at the very least be siblings or related in some way\n\n**Carian Knight #4: Carian Manor Spirit**\n\n* **Observation:** As the name suggests, this Carian Knight is found at Caria Manor, though they are already deceased\n* **Observation:** When spoken to, their dialogue indicates that their loyalty is specifically to Ranni: \"Lady Ranni, we have long awaited you. I pray for your house's swift arrival. May the full moon shine upon Caria.\"\n* **Observation:** While I cannot directly confirm this myself, this [face guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3275057381) suggests that Moongrum's model is reused here; there's no canon reason to believe this is Moongrum's twin brother, but I won't stop you from speculating\n* **Observation:** It is important to me, for the sake of Carian Knight #17, that this reinforces that Carian Knights were \"direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses\", of which Ranni once was (**EDIT:** This is poorly phrased -- what I'm getting at here is that this Carian Knight seems to not just be a direct retainer to the Carian princesses in general, but possibly specifically to Ranni)\n\n# Carian Troll Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #5: Bols**\n\n* **Observation:** Locked inside the Cuckoo's Evergaol, clearly implying that it was the Knights of the Cuckoo who imprisoned him there, and that he defended Caria when the Academy split from Caria in the aftermath of Radagon's departure\n* **Observation:** Wields the Troll Knight's Sword, specifically with the ability to cast Greatblade Phalanx\n* **Observation:** Drops Greatblade Phalanx when killed, which is said to be used by the enchanted troll knights\n\n**Carian Knight #6: Troll Knight in Caria Manor**\n\n* **Observation:** Effectively the same moveset as Bols (**EDIT:** Just assume this is true for all Troll Knights)\n* **Theory:** By virtue of where this Troll Knight is found, this Troll Knight is still loyal to the Carian Royalty, and is one of the few Troll Knights that are still living\n\n**Carian Knight #7: Troll Knight outside Converted Fringe Tower**\n\n* **Theory:** One can assume, given the role of Carian Knight #6, that this Troll Knight was loyal to the sorcerer controlling the Converted Fringe Tower. It is unlikely this sorcerer was a Carian princess, so it leaves a question as to why the enchanted troll knight here, still clad in Carian armor and wielding Carian weaponry, pledged their loyalty to a sorcerer. However, this would not be the only example of this kind of questionable allegiance, especially because we know that they fell into disarray with the decline of the royal family.\n* **Observation:** This tower in East Liurnia contains Haima sorceries and requires those who enter to be in possession of a Glinstone crown, to know the Erudition gesture, and to perform it in front of the statue of Marika; there is another Converted Tower in West Liurnia with a similar requirement.\n* **Theory:** As this is not a Sorcerer's Rise, and a statue of Marika is found in it, and one must display their \"Erudition\" (or in other terms, their \"Intelligence\") in front of the literal embodiment of \"Faith\", maybe there's something suggesting that these towers were \"converted\" from outposts that once belonged to Erdtree forces to Carian/Academy Towers.\n* **Theory:** Whoever controlled this tower, if it was not Haima themselves (as they were the adjudicator of the Academy), belonged to Haima's conspectus. Given that a Graven School is found here, this particular sorcerer may have some strong ties to the Primeval Current, or at the very least Sellen and Azur. There is definitely some lore worth reconciling.\n\n**Carian Knight #8: Troll Knight in Castle Ensis**\n\n* **Observation:** A similar parallel between Moongrum and Moonrithyll, this Troll Knight parallels the Troll Knight found defending Caria Manor\n* **Theory:** This Troll Knight may explicitly have been friends with Moonrithyll, given her camaraderie with the Troll Knights\n* **Theory:** We can assume a similar characterization with Rellana, i.e. they would have also demonstrated the \"unparalleled devotion of those who left their homelands to serve Rellana.\"\n\n**Carian Knight #9: Blue Spectral Troll Knight in Liurnia Highway North**\n\n* **Observation:** Seemingly protects the road leading to the Academy from Raya Lucarian soldiers. May serve the Twinsage sorcerer at the Highway Lookout Tower, who summons a small squadron of Aristocrats and Wandering Noble Sorcerers in front of the tower.\n* **Theory:** It is worth noting that the Twinsage sorcerer's presence may not be dissimilar to how the Converted Towers were taken over, though in this particular instance, the Twinsage sorcerer took this tower from the Raya Lucarian soldiers...which, seems odd if you consider that they're both supposed to be aligned with the Academy against Caria. The game does allude to the Cuckoo Knights' \"refusal to be mere servants of the academy\", so perhaps these are the embers of a war between Raya Lucaria and the Cuckoos? If so, it is curious to see a Carian Knight on the side of the Academy against the Cuckoos.\n* **Question:** Sort of a general question I have for people who may understand the concept better than I do: I often see these blue spirits referred to as \"puppets\", but can't find an example of where this is explicitly referenced. Do we know for sure that these are puppets?\n* **Theory:** If the above is true, than this Carian Knight, as well as all the Wandering Noble spirits, is clearly under the control of the Twinsage sorcerer, possibly unwillingly\n* **Observation:** In contradiction to the above, there are two cases that I feel contradict the notion of a 'puppet'. The Rennala projection can an oath-sworn Troll, suggesting that the 'oath' may extend beyond life itself, and can be invoked in a manner similar to spirit ashes, though these spirits are not blue. Fia, on the other hand, summons her champions (through what mechanism, I'm not sure), and they definitely *are* blue, which calls into question whether or not they are puppets, or are similarly oath-sworn.\n\n# Headless Spectral Troll Knights\n\n**Carian Knights #10, #11, #12: Headless Spectral Troll Knights guarding the Four Belfries**\n\n* **Observation:** There are three headless knights here, though only one \"spawns\" in the way that Carian Knight #9 does. The other two are seemingly always there.\n* **Observation:** Curiously, even though this area is known as the \"Four Belfries\" there are only three waygates.\n* **Theory:** There is a connection, though unclear, between these Headless Troll Knights and the Mausoleum Soldiers/Knights guarding the Walking Mausoleums and the Black Knife Catacombs. We know that Mausoleum Knights invoked a \"self-inflicted curse that ties the spirits of these loyal knights to the land, having willingly beheaded themselves so that they may serve their masters in death.\"\n* **Theory:** There is no evidence for this, but one potential theory is that each waygate corresponds to one of the Headless Troll Knights. Perhaps it was the sacrifice of each of these knights that closed off the waygates, and it is through an oath or self-inflicted curse that they continue to protect these waygates as spectral beings. It remains unclear what the Four Belfries have to do with Caria, but their being in Liurnia naturally creates strong ties to begin with. Likewise, hard to know whether these waygates are being protected in the name of Caria.\n* **Question:** Maybe people have elaborated on this in other posts, but the relief of a bearded man in front of the branches fo the Erdtree strikes me as similar to the reliefs of the Haligtree found in throughout the Haligtree itself, e.g. on the tombstones found in the graveyard near the Haligtree Roots. Is this a connection or similarity that I'm imagining?\n\n**Carian Knight #13: Headless Spectral Troll Knight guarding Fifth Belfry outside Castle Ensis**\n\n* Pretty much everything stated about Carian Knights #10, #11, and #12 applies to this Carian Knight. Its proximity to Castle Ensis strongly reinforces the connection between the Four Belfries and Caria.\n\n# Unconfirmed, but likely Carian Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #14: The Great Coffin west of Liurnia of the Lakes**\n\n* **Observation:** This Great Coffin stops at the edge of the lake, directly across from Testu's Rise, and contains a Carian Knight's Sword. It is escorted by a large group of Cuckoo soldiers. The path taken by the Great Coffin is also patrolled by a Cuckoo Knight pacing back and forth repeatedly.\n* **Observation:** Though it is now cut content, we know from a note on Great Coffins that they \"travel the Lands Between, carrying the bodies of nameless fallen warriors.\" It is therefore more than reasonable to assume that this Great Coffin is carrying the body of a fallen Carian Knight, though one seemingly respected by the Cuckoos.\n* **Theory:** Stopping at the edge of the western lakeshore may indicate that this Carian Knight has some sort of connection, either a fondness or a desire to be laid to rest here, or maybe it has more to do with the preferences of the Cuckoos escorting the Great Coffin. It's not terribly clear. However, the fact that it is across from Testu's Rise is interesting, as it again paints a picture of a Carian Knight who, possibly, was loyal to a sorcerer. Moreover, Testu may or may not have had abilities related to necromancy, as the puzzle that needs to be solved in order to enter the Rise raises putrid corpses from the ground.\n\n**Carian Knight #15: The Tombstone in Raya Lucaria graveyard**\n\n* **Observation:** Three Putrid Corpses (either possessed by way of sorcery or by glintstone itself) are seemingly worshipping this tombstone, upon which lays the armor of a Carian Knight.\n* **Theory:** One can infer that the tombstone, and therefore the grave it sits atop, once belonged to a Carian Knight, one who possibly lived and died at a time when Caria and the Academy were still aligned. It is unclear why the Putrid Corpses are drawn to this grave, but one can infer that, even in a state of seeming undeath, they retain enough sense to revere this Carian Knight that they may have known, recognized, or even revered in life.\n\n# Unconfirmed, may or may not have been Carian Knights\n\n# \n\n**Carian Knight #16: Corpse in Highway Lookout Tower**\n\n* **Observation:** This corpse is found directly behind the Twinsage sorcerer at the top of the Highway Lookout Tower, though it may be unlikely that the Twinsage sorcerer killed this individual, as the corpse is smoldering. It is in fact identical to the corpse found in the lower levels of the Roundtable Hold, except that it is holding a rusted rapier, possibly suggesting that it was present at the battle that had occurred at Liurnia Highway North involving the Marionettes and the Flame Chariots.\n* **Observation:** Quite critically, the Carian Glintblade Staff is found on this corpse, which we know were gifted to Enchanted Knights. It is unlikely that this staff would be found in the hands of anyone other than a Carian Knight for this express reason.\n* **Observation:** There is precedent for items relating to a specific character being found on a smoldering corpse implied to have been said character: Lionel's armor can be found on a corpse sitting on a bed directly next to where the Deathbed Dress is found. Lionel is already one of Fia's champions, and declared himself to be her father in life when they met, so it's fairly clear that this smoldering corpse was Lionel.\n* **Theory:** Regarding that battle, I think it may have been separate to the battle that is presently occurring between the Cuckoos and the Twinsage sorcerer's blue spectres. Everything being rusted is one indication, but the other is all the Exile Soldier and Banished Knight weaponry found marking the battlefield; this weaponry is also found inside the tower. Stormveil is within riding distance of this area, so it's possible that this was a battle between Stormveil forces and the Academy.\n* **Theory:** Alternatively, given that the Spirit NPC states that the puppets were besieging \"us\", from the perspective of a Wandering Noble Sorcerer spirit, maybe this was where the Academy first betrayed Caria.\n\n**Carian Knight #17: The Ash of War dropped by the Night's Cavalry in Liurnia**\n\n* **Theory:** By far the weakest and maybe the most unnecessary case for a Carian Knight, but I didn't want to ignore it. I had previously made a post suggesting that the Ashes of War dropped by the Night's Cavalry were once the Weapon Skills of warriors that they had defeated. This Ice Spear is said to be a \"skill of the warriors who served Lunar Princess Ranni.\" It does not explicitly state that this is a Carian Knight, but we do know Carian Knight #4 had clear ties to Ranni. Enchanted Knights, when they were a starting class, once wielded the \"Winged Spear\", which eventually became just the \"Spear\" in the final game. In both the CNT and the final game, this weapon \"can be wielded from behind the safety of a raised shield\", which may reference the Carian Knight's Shield, and is also said to be \"very effective against mounted foes\", which suggests that Carian Knights would have encountered mounted foes in Liurnia. While it's likely this could have been referencing Erdtree Sentinels and later Cuckoo Knights, this Enchanted Knight may have come across and been felled by a Night's Cavalry. Moreover, we know that the Spear is infusable; if we look to Blaidd as a reference to what happens when an oath is sworn, his \"sword was imbued with a cold magic at the moment oath was sworn\", which could have occurred if this Enchanted Knight swore an oath to Ranni, granting them the Ice Spear as a Weapon Skill.",

I did have one realization though, and couldn't believe that I didn't noticed before:\n\n* In the Great Hollow, we find corpses of the Giants that we see marching in the sea around Limveld. I never noticed this, but they have a bottom jaw bone with teeth wrapped around their head. It is almost certainly bone, and distinctly different to the rest of their body, which kind of confirms that they are connected to the giant skulls found around the Lands Between.\n\nI've finished both of the new bosses and all the remembrance quests as well, and there are plenty of \"possible\" secrets. Here are a few off the top of my head (spoilers obviously):\n\n* Scholar is a \"young\", 1st generation Albinauric Male.\n* During the Scholars quest, a Godskin Apostle shows up with two Cuckoo Knights to stop you from retrieving the \"Cleansing Tear\". These enemies paired together is interesting, though not surprising to me given what I believe about that whole chunk of the lore.\n* I'm still piecing things together, but I think the Cleansing Tear might end up being the \"birthing droplet\" that Letenna gives to the large Albinauric women at the end of her quest. The Scholar says something along the lines of \"find out manifest desire and reclaim our fair\". I think he believes that it can cure their advanced aging at first, but his quest end by saying \"it has not the power to change our fate. It is however, an artifact of great import - let it be know to history\".\n* The Dreglord has the skull of Manus, has a very similar build and weapons to Manus, and fights like Gael. To me, he is what's left over from the Dark Souls universe, a culmination of corpses after the world converged in on itself at the end of Dark Souls 3, which is why he shares the form and weapon of Manus and fights like Gael, not to mention the reuse of the word \"Dreg\" (The Dreg Heap). Never forget the tweet from the Dark Souls Twitter account prior to the games release: *\"In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright.\"*\n* Edit: Just remembered as well, and I could be completely wrong about this because I'm still putting it all together, but the Undertaker \"might\" be the grown up child of the Recluse.\n\nThat's all I can remember right now, but there is heaps of little things.",

Nothing concrete, really just Headcanon. \n\nFair Warning, this will be long. Why? Because there are potential tangential connections between some things spoken here with other elements of the game\u2019s world. Does any of this matter? No, but it\u2019s fun, if very runny (it\u2019s actually quite messy but I\u2019ll release it as it is; Forsaken Hollows won\u2019t load for me and I\u2019m getting impatient). \n\nThere will also be comments {below} relating to older games. They can be skipped. They are there to connect ideas between games and display common themes. \n\n//////////////////////////////////////\n\nSnake-Snails (Snailkes)\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nWhy do they exist? I think what\u2019s squarely to blame is the Crucible. The Crucible is responsible for animal-like traits being transferred onto humans via mutation, but it\u2019s also tied to creatures such as the Hippopotami, chimeric beasts found in the Realm of Shadow (and who fight alongside Crucible Knights in Nightreign), meaning it also meshes and melds the features of various animals onto other animals. \n\nThere are five Snake-Snail variants (one unused). The standard Snake-Snails appear in Volcano Manor, appropriately, as well as in other disparate location such as Nokstella and Rauh. They drop Serpent Arrows, attributed to a group known as the Formless Serpents. They slither, bite, and spit poison. Not much to note, but the Rauh location feels like it points towards my Crucible Hypothesis rather cleanly. \n\nThe Volcano Manor hosts the God-Devouring Serpent so there\u2019s a correlation with their appearance there. \n\nIt should be noted that you can connect Snakes with the element of fire in this game via their symbology, finding their way amongst the Godskins, Rykard, and Messmer; one of Messmer\u2019s symbols is a caduceus (a classical symbol involving two snakes), a sort of spiral, thus perhaps associating the snake with the Crucible and its spiral symbol; a connection possible to make due to minor details like how flame spirals in various magical forms, such as Furnace Golems which have Fire Giant Masks, giants being blessed by the Crucible according to the Talisman-of-all-Crucibles, and Embers of Messmer\u2019s being used to craft Fire Spritestones out of Rauh Burrows. The physiology of Godskin Nobles are also compared to the melding of the Crucible via their robes, and they bear reptilian tails. \n\nSnakes are also associated with poison, obviously; it should also be noted that Marais Manor, east and downstream of Gelmir, apparently once hosted the wielders of the Serpent Arrows (according to early versions - 1.00 apparently; my only source is a spreadsheet put together by Garden of Eyes); the House and its members are sick and associated with poison. \n\nNokstella is a harder locale to connect, especially since I know most people haven\u2019t even noticed the Snake-Snails there. They are found in a small section of the lower city, to the right of the river going downstream from the Nokstella Grace. There are no real connections here, besides tangential connections of a distant nature which don\u2019t explain much of anything. \n\n1. Ranni was involved with the Eternal Cities, getting its assassins to her side. Her brother is connected to her conspiracy to assassinate Godwyn, but that doesn\u2019t really explain the Snake-Snails\u2019 appearance here. \n2. (Warning: Unhinged Archaeology [\ud83e\udd2e] Speculation) The Eternal Cities have no connection to the Crucible, but the Night may. Dewgems are lotus flowers found in the Realm of Shadow which are fed on Night-tinged dew. They are found by water here, notably appearing in Rauh. Another night related thing in this realm are Larval Tears which are conjured at Spirit Graves at Night. They are functionally the same as the Silver Larvae in the base game. There isn\u2019t much here; they aren\u2019t really anything besides natural vermin (I was going to go off on a tangent about the giant stone coffins which are depicted on stelae in the Ancient Dynastical territories; some SOTE concept art depicts one atop Rauh; basically I was going to say that the Rauh people became the Ancient Dynasties and Nox, but that\u2019s too conspiratorial for talking about why snake-snails are in Nokstella; especially since it doesn\u2019t even explain anything besides why they\u2019re in both locations). \n3. The Silver Tears of the Nox are based on Alchemical beliefs regarding quicksilver, a fluctuating semi-fluid substance. An important symbol of Alchemy is the snake (in other esoteric systems it can take the form of the Ouroburos), sometimes depicted as a three headed dragon representing salt (body), quicksilver (mind), and sulfur (soul). The caduceus is a related symbol consisting of snakes forming a spiral. A word that can be used to conceptually tie these things together is the word \u201cformless\u201d; it\u2019s used to describe multiple things relating to the Arcane stat, such as the Formless Mother, the \u201cFormless\u201d Dragon Communion Seal (according to the seal\u2019s description), and the Formless Serpents and \u201cFormless\u201d Silver Tears (according to the Silver Tear Mask description). \n\nThe Cobra-Snails got cut from the game so there\u2019s nothing to talk about regarding them. \n\nInstead we could talk about the arrows and their accompanying bow. I mentioned earlier that an early version of the game stated that the Formless Serpents were once minions of Marais; the bow is found in the Abandoned Cave, full of trashed Abductor Virgins. It would stand to reason these Formless Serpents were possibly minions of Rykard, the cave dump being a Volcano Manor storage site in Caelid due to an alliance between the Carian brothers\u2019. Radahn may\u2019ve had use for them, who knows. The bow is powered by pagan magic; Arcane; the God-Devouring Serpent potentially being considered a pagan God (alluded to by the Serpent-God\u2019s Curved Sword). The arrows have a caduceus in place of fletching. \n\nMakes me wonder\u2026 perhaps the Formless Serpents used Invisibility Sorcery to get their moniker, potentially because the dump is near Sellia and some Serpent-Snails are found in Nokstella?\n\nI bring that up because the Serpent-Snails drop the arrows for some reason. That always felt weird to me. They don\u2019t have pockets. Do we make them from them? Is this the only way (other than corpses) the devs could think of to get us these arrows? It feels like a Dark Souls 2 situation to me where we needed a certain animal enemy to drop a certain human item (I\u2019m specifically referencing the kobolds that drop Black Knight weapons). \n\nOther than them there is the crystal Snake-Snail, one you might encounter earlier as they appear in the Lakeside Crystal Cave. They appear in multiple locations where crystals are present, such as the Altus Tunnel, the broader Liurnian area, the Consecrated Snowfield (ice is crystal and treated as a type of Glintstone, appearing as buds here like the Crystal Bud), Sellia Crystal Tunnel, and the Moonlight Altar. \n\nGlintstone parasitizes life, as demonstrated by the Glintstone Fireflies they can drop. They can still spit poison and have additional powers such as spitting Glintstone as projectiles or trails. The areas they inhabit have the same overarching crystalline visuals so their crystalline properties are explainable, but why snake-snails in these locations? Besides crystal, (some of) these locations have Carian associations (which could involve Rykard) such as the Altus and Sellia Tunnels which have Crystallians at their ends. The Moonlight Altar is Carian property and those in base Liurnia are around the crystalline zones below the altar. The Snowfield holds the Rotten Duelists who are decorated with snakes; the snakes come \u201calive\u201d during grab attacks\u2026 but the Duelists have no apparent lore other than serving in ritual combat during Godfrey\u2019s reign, the snake being a despised symbol. Why are they rotten? Did they fight alongside Radahn/Malenia? Is it rotten blood? Did they enter Malenia\u2019s rotten gash? Besides them, Ordina is nearby, has Black Knife Assassins in its gaol, and Loretta serves the Haligtree, so\u2026 \n\nHonestly, there\u2019s no straightforward reason these little guys are so widespread, and aren\u2019t so widespread. Symbolic associations are nearby, but not every Crystallian cave is accompanied by Snake-Snails. Their presence is arbitrary. \n\nSkeletal Snake-Snails are\u2026 still snaily. They still fold into their shells and their skeleton\u2019s length is the same as the others. Their\u201dshells\u201d are large humanoid skulls. They are found in the Death Bird section of the graveyard within Leyndell\u2019s outer layer of walls, the Sage\u2019s Grotto (With Garris; Black Knife Assassin nearby), and the mass graveyard atop the Mountaintops (with the Mariner). \n\nThey are among Those Who Live in Death. They can breathe out Ghostflame Wraiths and nothing else. They can roll like the others, touching mouth to tail, which is interesting. It may not be intentional but this would replicate the shape of an Ouroboros. The Ouroburos is a symbol of a snake eating its own tail, symbolizing the cycle of life and death; rebirth. Since they live within death I would say this is fitting. \n\nThe graveyards they appear in are supposedly for the Golden Order as one is found in Leyndell\u2019s walls and the other is in the Mountaintops where the Golden Order fought the Giants. The latter does contain giant spirits, possibly traitors of the Fire Giants, like the trolls; if not it may be a grave for those before (astrologers and giants). Both have a local Deathbird so it\u2019s possible that both yards predate Order. Snakes would fit then, but why didn\u2019t the Order excise these elements? \n\nGarris\u2019s cave is an undead sanctuary, the snakes acting as Garris\u2019s familiars (the sheltering of the assassin here also makes sense). The cave is downstream of Mount Gelmir. \n\nSnakes are related to spirituality as seen by Rykard and Eingley, their body containing many spirits, even summoning them via the mouth and the dispersed heat from unsettling the corpses that make up the cavern floor (if you hadn\u2019t noticed, the mist that summons the fire wraiths during his fight is amassed from his swings hitting the ground). \n\nThe last Snake-Snail is the Spiritcaller Snail. They lack snail eyes and they shake their heads and tails to emit a ringing like a Spiritcaller Bell to summon forth spirits. One is in the Road\u2019s End Catacombs summoning a Crucible Knight to its defense. One lingers in the top floor of the Leyndell Catacombs where it summons Leyndell soldiers to its defense. A few are posted up in the Haligtree Village to summon Crystallians. A bunch of them linger in the Spiritcaller\u2019s Cave, summoning wolves, disciples of Okina, and Godskins. \n\nIt would seem to me that these guys are actually deployed, not just nesting. They may have an affinity with spirits but they defend positions strategically such as, what would\u2019ve been, the entrance to the Leyndell Catacombs, the Road\u2019s End\u2019s roots, and the Haligtree Village Roofs. It could just be coincidence. The Cave seems like their natural habitat as it flows with a magic river which supports the nearby flora (magic is residual life energy as explained by Sellen\u2019s explanation of Glintstone, as well as the forces behind Ghostflame and the powers of Ancestral Spirits and their followers). \n\nThe Cave is very interesting. We see wolves settle other caves so it seems they all perished but are kept alive by the snails who use them for defense. The disciples, the Inaba, chased Okina after he abandoned them. They sought death through combat, having found it and becoming fodder for the snails. The Godskins are the most thought-provoking inclusion. Their ghosts here would seem to imply some Godskin presence in the Mountaintops some time ago. There is a heavy fiery presence on the Mountaintops; besides the Fire Giants; it\u2019s possible Messmer served here due to the impalement of the giants and the presence of the Giant/Fell mask(s) on the Furnace Golems. Melina lights the Forge and is possibly the Gloam-Eyed Queen. I\u2019m not sure if the cult had a start on the Mountaintops but it might make sense given the fight with the Godskins and the war with the Giants happened early in Marika\u2019s reign. \n\nDon\u2019t remember if I mentioned it, but the Godskins are associated with snakes via one on Gelmir. I suppose the Snakes of this cave can further this connotation; this snaky connotation is further bolstered by the fact both the Godskins and Rykard wish to usurp. \n\nAn early fringe theory I remember is that the Godskins are Eternal City adjacent. Why? A few things. They morph like how quicksilver is described, though there is no shared visual language; there\u2019s also no shared visual language with the Crucible either. If they are kin to Melina it could at least explain some connection since they would be kin to Marika. The main connection is their use of black flame like how the Assassins use the Rune of Death, but the assassins are later, after the failed rebellion; they have a common cause at least. The Godskins are supporting rebelling forces, siding with Rykard (one also defends the death-stricken corpse of Ranni, the main plotter who used the assassins). \n\nSnake-Snails (Snailkes) inherit the broader symbolism of snakes, that being spirituality. The crystal ones contain Glintstone, the skeletal ones breathe wraiths, and the Spiritcallers summon spirits; Eingley contains and amasses spirits, etc\u2026\n\nI forgot to mention earlier, but the Abyssal Serpent of Messmer is also spiritual to some extent. The Furnace Pot says the flames of the Furnace Golems burn away both body and soul. The furnaces feasibly contain a combo of Fell and Abyssal Flame, but given the connotation of the Abyss and Serpents (harkening back to Dark Souls) it would seem the Abyssal Flame is what does the consumption. Flame is very spiritual; the Frenzied Flame similarly destroys souls, the Fell Flame is conducted by the Fell God who lives on through his subjects, Ghostflame destroys bodies and raises spirits, Destined Death\u2019s flames ensure death for body and soul, and the Black Flame is more ambiguous, being the tool of death for the Godskins, but potentially a weaker/ened version of Destined Death. \n\nThis theme of serpentine spirituality goes back to earlier games.\n\n////////\n\nSlugs\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nThe basic slug appears to be wrapped in a blanket of filth, appearing in filthy places themselves. They amass in the pools of the Shaded Castle, the moat around the Capital, the misty woods of the Altus (where they spit Deathblight), the sewers where they squelch in slop and manure, and even in Castle Sol. They typically spit slime to slow you (like a velvet worm) and drop white flesh. They are associated with filth, and perhaps death due to Sol and the woods. \n\nThere are also fire slugs. They appear on Mount Gelmir, but aren\u2019t exclusive to there. They appear near smoldering butterflies which flutter around in some very random areas; they also drop them. A batch can be found near the road to the Limgrave colosseum; to the right of the road leading there, just before the overhead bridge. Another batch is found on the lower plateau southeast of the Church of Vows; Fire Monks camp out here. Another bunch are on the right of the large walkway leading from the Outer Wall Phantom Tree Grace; before the Leyndell main gate walkway. Another bunch are northeast of the Guardian\u2019s Garrison. A bunch more are also found on the right side of the frozen river leading to Theodorix. Who knows if these are a species of their own or just slugs that have adapted to fire? I tried to figure this out via their neighboring butterflies. Smoldering Butterflies are found near fires, but are they the cause of them or merely follow them? I\u2019d say in some cases they follow such as seen with campfires; you\u2019d have to kill them in order to use them to start fires, so I don\u2019t think they intentionally start fires themselves. It\u2019s entirely pointless but are Burning Slugs another species, do fires transform slugs into them; are the butterflies responsible for wildfires; and why are these slugs sometimes found in such random locations? My hypothesizes are: Burning Slugs are a species and cause fires, attracting butterflies; butterflies cause fires and slugs burn in them; both are just attracted to fires (but were they burning before or no?).\n\n///////////\n\nSlimes\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nSlimes are messes of filth and dead flesh. They\u2019re made from necrotic flesh and can contain maggots, feathers, hair, and bones. They have many variants, including poison, rot, blood, lightning, and putrescence. They seem to be creatures that have melted and amassed, yet still live due to the Rune of Death being taken away, such undying devastation being possible because of the Shattering war which has caused \u201cdead\u201d masses to congeal and transform. \n\nWithout access to the roots, and with traditional death being gone, these things amass in squalid conditions where the dead go unburied (Rot brings forward new life). They\u2019re their own living things now. \n\nThe basic kind are found in the squalid muck outside the Murkwater Catacombs, on the ramparts of the Lower Morne Castle, in corners of Redmane Castle, Wyndham Catacombs, and the Consecrated Snowfield. \n\nThe poisonous green kind are found in the pools of the Tombsward Cave and Seethewater Cave. \n\nThe rotten kind can be found in certain areas in Caelid, but prominently in the Minor Erdtree Catacombs. They seem to contain bug shells like those of the Kindred of Rot. \n\nThe bloody kind seem fresh as they are soaked red and covered in blisters. They are found in the Writhblood Ruins, Moghwyn Palace, and Blood Ruins in Nightreign. They may be made of the Dynasty\u2019s victims, perhaps they are ritually soaked to be kept bloody for the mother. \n\nThe lightning kind are found on the Jagged Peak, surging with red lightning. They\u2019re probably made of melted dragon, particularly the Drakes who inherited Bayle\u2019s Lightning. Either that or they\u2019re made of the men who made the climb. Perhaps a mix of both. \n\nThe Putrescence is the remains of ancient beings once contained in the colossal coffins of the Cerulean Coast and Fissure. The flesh is sloppy, wet, and mucky; it doesn\u2019t appear like rotten flesh, instead more like frozen cafeteria slop. I suppose these would form in cold conditions like the fissure; they\u2019ve had time to melt and accumulate. They were burnt by cold Ghostflame in the past (according to the Putrescence Spells), perhaps helping make their melted appearance and color; the conditions are also similar to the Gaols which are lit with Ghostflame and have their own brand of wet amassed flesh (It\u2019s possible the Hornsent were inspired by the practice of the coffins). This flesh is close to the spiritual as well as it can be used to make Piquebone Arrows which conjure shadows where they land, shadows which appear similar to those produced by the Alluring Pot which bears the markings of the Two Fingers, and are made with bone shards and Albinauric Blood; this suggests a spiritual power is behind the \u201cillusion\u201d, and implications regarding Albinaurics; are Albinaurics spiritual due to the \u201csilver\u201d they\u2019re made of? I remember some people suggesting that the putrescence is made of constructed people, like claymen/silver-beings as to explain the illusion and these peoples\u2019 supposed impurity according to the congealed putrescence description (the shadows are similar in appearance to Shadow Bait, a spell of the Two Fingers which suggests they may have some spiritual power, or are at least skilled conjurors; Rhia isn\u2019t far away, and they can create Shadows as servants; according to Recluse\u2019s questline one cannot live without a shadow). Putrescence at least has bones as can be seen by skeletons that animate among it, as well as the Putrescent Knight; to note, its cleaver scales off Arcane; is this due to the nature of putrescence or is it the nature of the corpses? Also to note: Silver Tear weapons do not scale with arcane, but the Silver Tear Mask improves it so\u2026 ehh?\n\n(Archaeology Speculation) The coffins are a curiosity, but are possibly predecessors to the Ancient Dynasty as they depict the same bearded man their statues depict, a bull (which is one of the dynasty\u2019s icons), and they\u2019re depicted at the top of the Dynasty Stelae. The worship of horns is also shared by the Ancestral Followers around the Dynasty ruins and Hornsent who live in the land of the coffins. The stelae also depicts trees as important, so I\u2019d presume some shaman/Hornsent connection here as both worshipped trees (Enir Ilim has trees with faces; the God who entered the gate, Marika, was presumably gifted the Erdtree\u2019s seed by the Two Fingers according to the Seed +1 Talismans; the Hornsent would presumably worship the Two Fingers, seen by the shack outside Rhia and praying corpse in Dheo, as they desired a God); also the Nox settled their cities near these ruins (they are Marika\u2019s relatives). I also have to mention the DLC concept art, that of a coffin atop Rauh\u2026 what does this mean? Were they built atop stuff and then slid down when\u2026 whatever catastrophe that happened\u2026 happened? Be it a fallen star, be it volcanos, the coffins sunk into the stone. \n\nDid the coffins once summon a God? Is that what the Hornsent is basing their massacre upon? The jarred shamans are made of accumulated flesh and can have many faces; they also fire homing flesh, and their title as shamans connotates some spiritual strength, so were they chosen above others to be massacred for being potent spiritual fuel? \n\nI was going to actually talk about Silver Tears and the Molten Tears, but those are an entirely different topic, even if Silver Tears relate to alchemy like snakes, and morph like slime.

    "body": "This is the third of a series of posts where I delve into the the narrative of Elden ring as an introspective journey Marika undergoes externally through the journeys of the mending rune bearing tarnished after her disillusionment with the order and her grief in relation to the death of Godwyn's soul.\n\nFia as a mother to Godwyn, opressed life giver and ritualistic prostitute.\n\nGoldmask as a sage and soul seeker in the depth of the golden order.\n\nDung eater as the manifestation of the hornsent's foul legacy and the karmic dept or sin that was born of what they did to her and what she did to them.\n\nThis is going to be THE longest post of the three as even though Dung eater as a character appears to be the least interesting of the bunch and his questline is best described as deranged and his mending rune as morally abhorrent. His existence or rather what he represents is a surrender to generational hatred and an embrace of original sin itself.\n\nThe sun realm :\n\nThe sun realm is precisely mentioned in ONE item description on a random chance drop shield but it's existence is hinted at constantly and consistently through most of the lands between.\n\nBefore the DLC all we had were a bunch of inconsistent and quite frankly worthless information about a bunch of skeletons and wraiths. But with the robust portrayal of the hornsent we can confidently confirm that : the sun realm did exist, it did dominate the lands between, it practiced storm and divine beast veneration as aspects of the crucible and partook in dragon communion, stuborn clinging to life, it's main fighting force were the banished knights led by commanders Niall and O'Niel (meaning son of Niel or Niall btw) and most importantly it honored death. The sun realm is not necessarily the hornsent but they are it's ideological and cultural center, not all of them need to bear horns.\n\nThe most ancient elden lord we find in the story of the lands between is Placidussax who lies in the storm beyond time at the heart of Farum Azula and the beasts that serve him. Now their wildness and vitality drained away in exchange for the fingers and intelligence granted upon them (descriptions of the cinquedea and beastial vitality). The hornsent worship this storm and venerate it and the beasts who dwell in it and their movements as the most ancient signifier of divinity and primacy. The banished knights, who use these storm innovations, partake in dragon communion to honor the ancient dragons, have dragons on their helmets and were given the choice of either banishment or servitude to Godfrey after his defeat of the lord of stormveil. The ones that accepted still render service to the golden lineage to this day in stormveil serving Godrick, the ones that refused either prowl Farum Azula, or the mountaintops and Caelid as ghosts let by their commanders. In nightreign, the banished knights in the castle even kneel to the horned colosseum lion in front of the gate. The banished knight armor and weaponry even litters practically every major non Carian fort in the lands between. Architectural clues are also very useful here, as Castle Sol is named after the sun, the eclipe imagery is also very clear adding to the sun connotations. Castle morne is also under control of the golden lineage as Castellan Edgar is there under orders of Godrick. \n\nThe sword of castle morne is also a massive hint linking the banished knights, stormveil, the sun realm and the death birds. As the model for the sword without the other blades grafted on top is similar to the death ritual spear and feather branch talisman, not just in design but also in spirit. The spear is the weapon of those accepted by the death birds to strengthen them but also a symbol of the promise of the death birds to repay that companionship with resurrection in the far future. The sword strengthens the user through channeling the spirits of the fallen clan still laying in the grafted blade in promise of vengeance. Stormveil castle also has some fascinating architectural clues as the two towers that look like they have a bite taken out of them near where you find the claw talisman bear a striking resemblance to the divine gate of Enir Illim. The claw talisman also depicts assassins who mimic the deathbirds.\n\nBut the most fascinating clues, are found not found there, they're in the shadow keep. As the shadow keep while not containing any banished knight equipment, holds a mass grave of knights where you fight commander Gaius. The architecture of the shadow keep is also not consistent, meaning some parts were probably built later as older parts more used as civillian ground became abandoned. The most damning part about the shadow keep being older than the war was the boats used to burn the soldier's golden ashes that are one to one the same boats the tibia mariners sail and use to guide the spirits lost in death. The helphen steeple also bears a striking resemblance to the steeples seen in the flooded part of the shadow keep, which should be an older part of the keep, called the church district.\n\nAncient Mesopotamia, again :\n\nEnir Illim, based on Bab-Ellim or Babylon is very clearly meant to reference the tower of Babylon meant to stretch to the heavens and reach God.\n\nIn Mesopotamia, one of the main partners of trade and relations was Dilmun. Dilmun was so important it was part of the Mesopotamian creation mythos as a paradise where there is no disease, predators eat no predators, pain is absent and people do not get old. As such it has several recently unearthed mass burial sites. This mythical land was ruled by the benevolent god Inzak, Anzak, Enzak or as he was known in the initial publications and research... Enshag. Making an interesting tie to the supposed lord of the lost and the desperate whose golden bones still cling to life even after all these years worn as armor by Gideon's lackey who's obsessed with getting the medallion leading to castle sol, Ensha. Clinging to life being necessary to provide a death worth offering to the death birds is a theme that ties Ensha to the death birds, tying all this giant mess into a semi coherent society with a center of culture and different regional practices befitting an empire spanning the whole of the lands between. The gate of divinity being the culmination of generations of spirituality and development into the harvesting of death as a way to create life. Life rises from death as it does from life, and from life through death, one gains power as stated by the remembrance of the regal ancestor. The great hammer given from this remembrance's horns are described as wings to reap the lives of the hornless. The horns of an ancestor spirit continue to bud like antlers as life that experiences no sprouting is offered to it through death creating tangled horns, to the hornsent their proof to be a chosen people. And winged creatures are said to be the envoys of death in ancient pagan faith as said by the winged scythe. The gate of divinity can be therefore assumed to be an attempt at creating the ultimate regal ancestor spirit, a true divine beast, that will reap the life of the hornless, melded harmoniously through shaman women flesh and deliver the hornsent to greater heights. A tradition carried on by Godrick through grafting the dead onto his shaman flesh that harmoniously blends with all others. The spiralhorn shield is therefore one of the earliest depictions and an abservation of the spiral current of the crucible by the primal people of Siofra, the ansestor followers funny enough are still found barely clinging in the lake of rot which poisons the ainsel river and both are massive and ancient burial grounds where corpses are thrown in stone coffins. The old man with the tablet, elden John as some call him in the communtiy, is a representative of the hornsent's ancient people's ancient people studied through the ruins of Rauh. And in his hands he holds a one to one replica of an artifact from Mesopotamia, the imago mundi, or map of the world. Mesopotamia itself means the land between two rivers, in the real world the tigris and euphrates, in elden ring, the ainsel and the siofra. The formless mother, in her infinite kindness to lord Mohg in the sewers, showed him his cursed blood's glorious past leading to his righteous desire to revive it, making him retreat to the ruins underground to learn of his lineage. Elden John has been discussed to death in the communtiy and has been found all over the place, Uld ruins, Rauh ruins, the ancient giant coffins and Enir Ellim. Giving the sun realm much deeper roots than belurat and the tower.\n\nHorah Loux - Serosh / Enkidu - Gilgamesh\n\nBut Mesopotamian mythos and it's connection to Elden ring doesn't end here. Gilgamesh was a prideful despot that the god Enki tried to teach a lesson to in humility to the gods. Enki creates a son then named Enkidu, son of Enki. Enkidu lives as one among beasts like horah loux until he is seduced and screwed into submission by a priestess of ishtar named Shamhat for 7 days and nights straight leading to the depletion of his exess in wildness and his civilization by her hand. Enkidu is then apalled when hearing about Gilgamesh and his actions and goes on to fight him to the death. From that fight is born a deep respect between both of them and Gilgamesh's pride is doubled. He then decides to cement his greatness by slaying the divine beast Humbaba that lives in a forest of giant trees after forging axes to do the deed. Humbaba is killed after Enkidu offers guidance and courage to Gilgamesh but now Enkidu's life is forfait as the gods punish him for the death of Humbaba. Gilgamesh learns beyond grief, and absolutely paralyzing fear of death and goes to the underworld to find a way to gain immortality. He gets in the form of a magical fish, he leaves the underworld and as he celebrates in a bath, his fish is eaten, by a serpent, the serpent then becomes immortal and keeps shedding it's skin every time Gilgamesh tries to kill it or in elden ring terms a serpent never dies. After more depression and monologue, dialogue... Gilgamesh decides to learn humility and instead be immortalised in his deeds through the smiles of his people and the stories they tell about him.\n\nThe hatred of the erdtree towards the serpent from the days of Godfrey here can be understood not only from the biblical sens but also Mesopotamian sens of usurpation of immortality from the king. Besides it's connotations and relations to the fell god, but that needs a whole discertation on its own.\n\nThe whole moral of the story is the acceptance of death by a man and a people that tenaciously and pridefully cling to life.\n\nThe culture of the hornsent while having tones of respect for the elders, the dead and valuing life had their culture slowly turn into a cesspool of hatred, fear of death and denial of their atrocities as specified by the caterpillar mask but also denial of the truth as they imprisoned the lamenter.\n\nTheir curse to turn into flies is fitting divine punishment and proof that the hornsent deeply lacked empathy as the people who cared for the sick never became ill. The mother of flies is excellent at offering punishment and she seems quite fond of showing herself to the horned like the bloodfiends who saw a twisted deity in the visage of their tutelary deity.\n\nThere's even a multitude of theories saying the ritual to ascend to godhood requires death of the lord with good proof as Miquella reproduces this without flaw. So then as the golden prince and a lordling, Godwyn's death would have been necessary for him to ascend as lord of Ranni. His mending rune even evokes a black sun, but Marika's plans to put forth Godwyn as her candidate for lordship in the war she planned ever since she banished Godfrey broke. And through his incomplete death, Godwyn became first of the undead and ruler of those who live in death. A continuation of the sun realm tradition, his resurrection was even planned through a failed eclipse. Mohg even respects this tradition yet challenging Godwyn's ancestral claim by declaring his dynasty the Mohgwyn dynasty. Ansbach, a pureblood knight of Mohg is educated enough in these people's customs that he is able to decipher the rite of ascension to Godhood.\n\nThe hornsent are a very prideful, rotten people who's spirits cling to their descendants and whose ancestors persisting as tutelary deities is an honor. Taylew, a golem that was small, weak and the first one to stop functioning was honored through death into becoming the guardian deity of smithing. Meaning there is genuine power and true honor in being first of the dead, a theme in Miyazaki's older works as well.\n\nThe omen curse : \n\nThe curse of the omen manifests in tangled horns all over the body, a very distinct muscular and monstrous frame and nightmares. Golden black fire like the scadutree is seen attacks by omen with royal blood who still have their horns intact. The hornsent don't exhibit these traits.\n\nMarika was so afraid of the curses of the hornsent that she directed Messmer to be the bearer of this curse in her stead. But as his kindling states, that hatred would not be confined. He even curses her himself for his last words.\n\nIn the dlc one of the first ghosts you see speaks to his dead fellows telling them to keep clinging to their hatred so he can fashion curses from it. The grandam has acess to a wraith spell manifesting rancor, the horned bairn item is similar to the omen bairn in function, the hornsent NPC is eaten alive by his desire for vengeance, the revenger of castle morne clings to the souls of his clan through their blades to grant him strength, Ensha refuses to give up on life, the red and blue branch talismans... there's so many examples of hornsent and sun realm clinging to life beyond death and showing rancor as the result. The hornsent are extremely adept at cursing people, at least that's the conclusion I arrived at.\n\nThe omen curse is not the aspects of the crucible randomly being propped into existence. It's the conclusion of an active effort of a dead people to curse the souls of the people of the erdtree. Through their very bloodlines. The curse, when unleashed by Morgott calls forth a spiral of tarnished, dull red gold that causes a rainstorm to occur. Similar to the divine invocation. Mohg through his acceptance of the formless mother and his cursed blood, is able to channel his plight into wings echoing the very first divine warriors who learned from the birds. To note, the deathbirds, not the death rite birds, have shriveled wings that have a brownish color that fades into a dull yellow and then gray. The twin bird is depicted as both red and blue.\n\nThe dung eater : finally.\n\nThe dung eater when viewed through this context is a manifestation of hatred and the weight that causality holds in the world of elden ring. His armor, exised horns with a large pendant depicting the sun, evokes a desire to embody the very concept of hatred of the golden order and the annihilation of the hornsent at their hands. His barbarity isn't random, he says so himself, that he has to defile every corpse with care, it's ritualistic. His screams even call forth the wraiths similar to the omen and hornsent, a blessing and guidance from his ancestors. He doesn't just want to do it. He feel he has to do it to honor his ansestors restless spirits demanding vengeance, it's a duty.\n\nThe dung eater is a tarnished, not an omen. He is a descendant of a warrior of Godfrey making his link to the sun realm by bloodline quite probable.\n\nA seedbed refers to the genital area of males, more specifically the testes and can be used as euphemism for the general area of the crotch. Dung eater's victims all apear to be exclusively male, with a bloody crotch. So when he says he's cursing your bloodline, he's doing it literally, straight from the source.\n\nHis realisation that he needs to be the recepient of his blessing is a repetition or parody of the jarring of the shamans as instead of self reflection upon the evil act he fully accepts it and even goes through it to ensure his vengeance.\n\nA surrender to hate and cycles of violence and curses, dead in a sewer, after a lifetime of misery inflicted upon others and himself. A grand and brilliant fate to such a storied and deeply rooted civilisation. The karmic dept of the world becoming so deeply entrenched, Marika alone can't bear it, everyone has to bear it's consequence as there is no way to sever causality and the first sin will follow all. Marika through this refuses to let go of the past and embraces letting all the world share in the curses flung at her.\n\nFeel free to give feedback.\n\n\n\n",

Each level of the Divine tower gets smaller and smaller, and the base is noticeably thicker than anything in the base game. I also \"climbed\" the tower and found the area where the lift would normally be in the base game.\n\nThe implication of this is that in the base game, we are only seeing a large portion of the top of the tower.

    "body": "In the cutscene where he asks Radahn to be his consort, he also tells Radahn: \"I'm going to be a God\". I feel like people don't realize what that means. \n\nIf Miquella has already decided he's going to be a god and has set a plan in motion, then at that point he already knows about the ritual scroll. He knows that what is needed is a Lord's \\*\\*soul\\*\\* and a vessel for it. Meaning he already knew Radahn would have to die and is asking him to be his Consort \\*within that context\\*. He just asked Radahn to die. \n\n  \nThere's lore on Radahn's take on his own death, he wants to ensure he dies in honorable combat. He wants someone to kill him as he fights with all his might. He made a vow with Jerren saying this. \n\n  \nThis is what Malenia was doing in the Battle of Aeonia. The Young Lion set confirms this, since it tells us that when Malenia fought Radahn and let the scarlet flower bloom, she whispered in his ear: \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort\". She was there to kill him, per the vow. When she wakes up in the Haligtree she mentions that she is \"awaiting his return\", referring to Miquella. She knows he's off becoming a god and expects him to return with Radahn. \n\n  \nMiquella mentions \"our part of the vow\" in that flashback. That's what their part of the vow was. At the start of the Promised Consort fight, Miquella thanks both Malenia and the Tarnished for killing Radahn. Miquella and Radahn talked about the vow and Radahn agreed under the condition that he could meet his (again, necessary) death in honorable combat. \n\nThe Young Lion Armor has a Haligtree symbol on the cape and we see that during this time in his life, Radahn used the swords of Light and Lord. The descriptions of those swords imply that there's \\*something else\\* besides \"physical strength\" and \"gravity\" that Radahn relies on. It's Miquella. He uses the swords again when he becomes the Promised Consort. \n\nTo preemptively address a popular argument: people get hung up on the wording \"honorable\" combat, saying Malenia wasn't \"honorable\", but I think it just means to kill him while he's fighting his hardest in this case. But even if you don't like that, it's implied that Malenia never intended to go that far in the first place, he was simply so powerful that to kill him she had no choice but to use her hail Mary ult that literally cost her a piece of herself, just to meet his measure. And even doing that she didn't manage to kill him. \n\n  \nI think the vow with Jerren was probably made once the Battle at Aeonia was decided, to have Jerren ensure he dies \\*in combat specifically\\*. Because that's how he wants to die. ",

You won\u2019t ever live up to the Golden Order, but\u2026 well, you\u2019ve all played Dark Souls. It\u2019s merely a cycle.\n\nBut what does mending the Elden Ring in a default state mean? Well, look at the world around you. \n\nThe Golden Order was an undoubtedly a critique of the rise and the worldwide domination of Christian Capatalism. It is a critique of Amarika. And it\u2019s also a warning. \n\nThe Original Sin of Marika isn\u2019t so far off from Eves Original Sin.\n\nMetyr is the serpent that seduced Eve into usurping God. Once a child of God, she was abandoned, and so she became vengeful. \n\nThe Golden Order subjugates the Pagans through violence, they even use their own symbolism against them. They believe in one true god, they believe they are above the natural law. Marika is Crucified similarly to Jesus Christ.\n\nMarika has monopolized life and death. She created the Erdtree so that she could control who lived and who died based on how useful to the system they were. People could only have true death if they were accepted into the system. Kinda sounds like Heaven and Hell. \n\nBut it all backfired on her. The Omens arent just Hornsent descendants. They are the new, cursed Hornsent. A brutish reminder of the Crucible. The natural world fights back.\n\nAnd the most devastating blow to Marika, Godwyn. \n\nThe game states that the Shattering happened because of Godwyn. The lore community took this as an emotional reaction. I think it\u2019s a reaction of desperation. \n\nMarika didn\u2019t shatter the Elden Ring because she was sad that her son died. Fucking hell, Marika literally says \u201cif you are my son or daugher and you don\u2019t become anything then you will be SACRIFICED.\u201d \n\nMarika shattered the Elden Ring to stop Godwyn from usurping her. Deathblight overwrote Erdtree Burial. She didn\u2019t just lose her son, she lost control. \n\nMarika thought herself above death, she wanted to control it. But death isn\u2019t a belief. Death is life. \n\nRot; and Death may have been suppressed because of the removal of Destined Death, but the concepts didn\u2019t stop existing. They mutated into a twisted version of their natural state when given the chance. \n\nSpeaking of which, Fias ending was one of death restored. Not just Destined Death. But Deathblight as well. In Marikas attempt to weaken death, she made it significantly stronger. \n\nFia is the antichrist of Elden Ring. The one who would bring about the end of the Golden Order on a literal fundamental level. She is NOT bringing the world back to its natural state. \n\nDeathblight and Destined Death have the same source, but they are not the same thing. \n\nDestined Death was life and death controlled by the Greater Wills fate. With Deathblight you are God. You are the life and death within one vessel. You can\u2019t rot, you are no longer bound by the natural state. \n\nIf Deathblight was natural, it wouldn\u2019t be weak to Golden Order Fundamentalism which is a scientific study of the Greater Will.\n\nI believe you could most easily compare The Age of the Duskborn to Satanism. You are still within the order, but you become your own personal Greater Will. It\u2019s a story of self empowerment.\n\nBelieve it or not, the Dungeater is also a twisted part of Order. \n\nThe Age of Despair is the revenge of the Hornsent upon the Golden Order. In this ending you are forcing the entire world to be equally cursed together. Likely symbolic of Communism, we are all in it together equally. \n\nA lot of people view Goldmasks ending to be a continuation of the Golden Order. And to that end, you are both right and wrong. The Golden Order isn\u2019t just a religion, it is a science, it is as political stance!\n\nGoldmask does not abandon the science behind the Golden Order. He abandons the religion behind it. While he is still a Fundamentalist, he loses his faith in Marika and the Gods. Goldmask is an Agnostic Atheist. Order that isn\u2019t dictated\nby faith, but by science. \n\nThe last 2 endings are my favorite and by far the most complex.\n\nRannis Age of Stars is Anarchy. She spent her entire life controlled by Marikas Golden Order. I think in this way many of us can sympathize with her. But her circumstances were not that of a normal person; So she grew up not to hate Golden Order, but Order itself.\n\n\u201cThe certainties of sight, emotion, faith, will all become impossible. As it is now Souls and Order tightly bound, but I would have them at great remove.\u201d \n\nIn Rannis ending, we send the Elden Ring to the Stars. This is symbolic of us losing control over order. While it\u2019s true that Ranni is a love interest, it\u2019s important to see the bigger picture. The community didn\u2019t see this; So they added into the DLC this: \u201cOnze realized that the Procession of the Stars ended in ruin\u201d\n\nProcession: Follow in an orderly fashion. \n\nOrderly Fashion means the Elden Ring.\n\nThe Elden Ring ending up with the stars ends in ruin. Anarchy isn\u2019t really an option at the end of the day.\n\nNightreign shows us this. While the world may burn, Order has merely been abandoned; not destroyed entirely.\n\nThe abandonment of Order would be the Frenzied Flame. This is the nuclear option. You are not changing Order; Nor are the you abandoning it. You are destroying it completely. What is, will become naught. \n\nThis ending wouldn\u2019t even be an option if the world wasn\u2019t in the state it was in. This isn\u2019t just comically evil nihilism. This is cosmic balance. Karma. The consequence of an unfixable fundamental imbalance forced into the system. \n\nGo back and play the Ds3 DLC. We literally are the FF. The old order is desperately clinging onto power, and we are tasked with burning it all away so a new world can be born. \n\nI guess if I had to choose I would pick Goldmasks ending.",

        "body": "I think the whole point of Millicent's quest is about this.\n\nMillicent's whole journey is one of having her fate altered to suit an agenda. This is done through Gowry's manipulation of the Unalloyed Gold Needle, the needle being an instrument that can weave the thread of fate. Depending on the outcome of her quest, she either succumbs to Gowry's fate and dies with the Unalloyed Gold Needle in her flesh in order to bloom,  OR she takes out the Needle and succumbs to the fate she decides for herself:\n\n&gt; \"That if I am to flower into something other than myself, I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.\" (Millicent dialogue)\n\nShe leaves behind that same instrument which weaves fate if she dies rather than bloom. Only, instead of Gowry's designs this new version of the Unalloyed Gold Needle contains Millicent's designs as reflected in its new description:\n\n&gt; \"There is something I must return to Malenia. The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.\" (3rd version of the Unalloyed Gold Needle's item description)\n\nTo bring all this back to Malenia: after she has been defeated by the player and has bloomed, we can apply Millicent's version of the Unalloyed Gold Needle to Malenia's bloom. In doing so, we have weaved Malenia's fate and returned to her that sense of \"dignity [...] that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot\". This indicates to me that her fate will now be similar to Millicent's: she would \"rather rot into nothingness\" than \"flower into something other than\" herself. So why did Malenia bloom in the first place?\n\nIt is extremely important to note that by giving Malenia's bloom Millicent's Unalloyed Gold Needle, we necessarily pull out Miquella's Needle. I think that this indicates that, just like Millicent with Gowry's Needle, Malenia's fate was manipulated with Miquella's Needle. They are both Needles, instruments that weave fate. Both Needles are engineered by someone with an agenda. The Needles purportedly grant the impaled person relief from the rot, yet at the same time when the impaled person dies with the Needle in their flesh, they bloom. The parallels here are striking, and it isn't unreasonable to believe that Miquella wanted Malenia's rot power to slay Radahn for the sake of acquiring a Consort. There is also a precedence for Miquella manipulating wills through his charm, so why not through altering fate?\n\nIn short: if Malenia is given the Unalloyed Gold Needle she will likely choose to rot away into nothingness rather than bloom into the true Goddess of Rot. If Malenia is not given the Unalloyed Gold Needle, the next and third time she is killed/betrayed, she will likely bloom into the true Goddess of Rot.",

It's also directly said that her humanity is what kept the Rot at bay, so it would be likely that the Rot would consume her. \n\nAlso keep in mind that Malenia is an Empyrean that doesn't have a twin person or other. Her existence is evidence that supports Marika not needing to have had a twin personality or other half. I'm pointing this out specifically because people say that Marika had to have always had one and it was just naturally Radagon or the Gloam Eyed Queen or someone else.",

If they cast their dead downriver, those remains would eventually contaminate the water and the coast.\n\n- if we know that the Aspects Of the CRUSIBLE Sprouted amongst giants, how then did it spread over to humans? \n\n\u2022 \"You Are What You Eat\": We see over and over that creatures in Elden Ring are susceptible to what they consume (Glintstone, Rot, Deathroot). I think the \"Omen\" curse (horns) comes from consuming the remains of the dead.\n\n\u2022 Herbivores vs. Carnivores: Some creatures may have developed horns from a carnivorous diet (eating the dead directly), which might explain why they are haunted by spirits. However, even herbivores in the Land of Shadow sprout horns. This suggests they are getting the curse from the land itself\u2014plants and water infused with these remains.\n\n\u2022 The \"Fell\" Link: It\u2019s interesting that the Omen curse is also referred to as \"The Fell Curse.\" Since the Fell God was worshipped by the Giants, this gives us a direct linguistic link between Omen/Horns and Giants.\n\n\u2022 The Lamenters: This fits perfectly with the Lamenters, who suffer a severe version of the curse. The backs of their heads look disturbingly like a Giant\u2019s face.\n\n\n\nPerhaps this contamination is the way the Giants\u2014or the Fell God\u2014are attempting to return to the Lands Between. \n\n(As we know you cannot TRULLY kill a god, you can trap it but even the god of rot managed to come back from being sealed away eventually, re-emerging as \u201cScarlett Rot\u201d) - unless you have a god slaying weapon I guess  \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to think this, but I\u2019m curious if you guys have insights I overlooked.

Predatory beasts who sit at the top of the hierarchy are the ones who devour other horned beasts, with the accumulation of divine vigor turning them into deific figures. \n\nHornsent culture, and the culture of the realm of shadow at large, center around doing things that typically stand apart as \"unclean.\" Their key practices center around undertaking, butchering, jailing, and execution. All things associated with various lower/outcaste groups in Japan, particularly a group called  'Burakumin' who were an outcaste group in Japanese society. It was composed of people who did certain jobs, and the label was inherited, regardless of what work their offspring (or **their** offspring) did. I think horns, and the cursed blood/filth that they are tied to, are the result of being exposed to death and blood.

That's it.\n\nSo while perhaps Dolores being made into a puppet is what split Gideon and Seluvis, Gideon probably isn't that bothered by it. Whether it's friend or adopted daughter, he doesn't care if either become a puppet. Not really.",

Yes, we see ruins of towns and a few settlements, but nowhere near enough to imply a population capable of supporting empires of the scale we are shown.\n\nI know Leyndell specifically might be empty because of the theory that its population was crammed into the buildings, creating the corpse wax we see everywhere (though I\u2019ve not seen an explanation for why everyone got shoved into their homes lol). But outside Leyndell, where is everyone?\n\nI understand that open world game design affects scale (I know they can\u2019t entirely accurately model an entire continent and its population) and the Tarnished return long after the Shattering. But if the Rune of Death was removed, meaning people basically stopped dying natural deaths, why aren\u2019t there more people around?\n\nBetween deathless populations, giant castles like Stormveil that imply large garrisons or civilian populations, and accounts of major historical wars\u2026 the current emptiness feels strange. Even accounting for the chaos of the Shattering, it seems like the world should be overrun with undying people, soldiers, and/or civilians.\n\nSo what\u2019s the lore explanation, if there is one?

Here is a list of all that have been completed:\n\n1. [Boggart](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1o61pk9/boggart_is_godwyn/)\n2. Vyke (you are here)\n\nMicrocosm analysis is taking smaller stories, regions, items, or characters and attempting to draw parallels to the main characters of the story, whom we know little about. An example is Miquella\u2019s story from the DLC being used to determine some of Marika\u2019s past. With that established, by the end of this post, I hope to use Vyke to convince you that Godwyn:\n\n* Almost became Elden Lord\n* Was a Knight of the Roundtable\n* Had 2 maidens he cared about\n* One was turned into a puppet and killed herself\n* The other was a dragon\n* Was imprisoned for associations with factions outside the Golden Order\n* Harbored doubts about Golden Order\n* Tricked into representing an outer faction in response\n\nWhy should we consider Vyke a microcosm? How is he like Godwyn?\n\n* Both love dragons\n* Both attain a high level of power before a fall from grace\n* Both end up infected\n* Both end up representative of forces outside the Golden Order despite having had places of honor within it\n\n# Vyke rejects grace because it requires he burn his maiden\n\n&gt;Iron armor singed and blistered by fingers. Worn by Vyke, knight of the Roundtable Hold. ***No other Tarnished was closer to the throne of the Elden Lord than Vyke***. But without announcement, Vyke traveled far below the capital, and was scorched by the flame of frenzy.\n\nVyke was like us, a tarnished who is rising among their talented fellows of the Roundtable Hold. Someone following the guidance of grace. \u201cNo other Tarnished was closer to the throne\u201d \u2013 I assume this means that Vyke made it all the way to the base of the Erdtree. We know he found the Subterranean Shunning Grounds, which means he made it into the heart of the city. I believe he had reason to visit these grounds because he made contact with the wall of thorns, but refused to sacrifice his maiden.\n\n&gt;You are about to sacrifice something precious. The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge. Only so that you may be Lord.\n\nWhat a horrible thing to ponder. Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not.\n\nBut how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon?\n\nShabriri may have an agenda, but he makes a good point here. The Golden Order is reliant on the sacrifice of maidens, something we should find horrifying.\n\n&gt;If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling and the girl can be spared ...setting you on the righteous path of lordship.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tapgpmzj1v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c939a6e11c0f6612c5b373936a9726cb468b77f3\n\nEven more important is another spell Vyke uses. In fact, he\u2019s the only one that ever casts it \u2013 Frenzied Burst. This spell tells us a lot. It tells us that Vyke is one of the few to establish some semblance of control over the frenzy flame. He\u2019s powerful enough to resist the madness to create this spell. Sage Midra also resists for quite some time. Both fight chaos and win at least one battle, even if they eventually lose the war.\n\n# Why would he inhibit his newfound powers?\n\n&gt;In the days of the past, a crown was warranted with strength.\n\nExcept for SL0 sickos, the mantra above applies to the vast majority of players who become Elden Lord. It\u2019s what happens when the main mechanic of your game is combat.\n\nSo why do we first find Vyke at the Church of Inhibition? Why would he inhibit himself? That\u2019s not usually how one becomes Lord.\n\n[An angry spirit Vyke defending a church of Marika](https://preview.redd.it/g7p9ydvr1v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=385dc7606ef4681df0d571c2cc10790e31b8de78)\n\nThe skeptical might say something like, \u201cHe\u2019s not holding back. He is seeking control.\u201d or \u201cHe got caught before he could really use his powers\u201d\n\nBut Lord Contender Vyke, he who we find jailed in the mountains, proves he is holding back. He holds back our entire fight with him. In fact, he seems to have gotten better at it. Not only is this Vyke a real human instead of a red phantom, he does not use any madness incants like his phantom. You might think this is an older version of Vyke, but this version also has the fingerprint armor on.\n\n[Notice the fingerprint burns. Their location is also important](https://preview.redd.it/7sgoknlz1v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1213926028463eb1a3632d3378e774e839d6c8e0)\n\nThis version of Vyke has been dealing with madness since he first caught it, assumedly a long time ago. Yet he doesn\u2019t seem to be impacted by it at all. Why would a champion of the frenzy flame spurn its use? This goes beyond control and veers into suppression. But why doesn\u2019t he use the power of the flame that he pursued at such cost? Why would he change his mind so drastically?\n\n# He didn\u2019t consent to the frenzy flame. He was grabbed from behind.\n\nVyke never wanted to use the flame on principal, he wanted to avoid sacrificing his maiden. Like Midra and Yura, he is a pawn in a larger game. Unlike us, he is not a willing one. You can tell because the angle and imprint pattern of the fingerprints on Vyke\u2019s armor only make sense if he was grabbed from behind.\n\n[The melting is more on the back than the front and that is illustrated in the art to the right](https://preview.redd.it/v0gtr30k2v4g1.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e4630ebc4f538c2ffa8df76afbf95eb42258584)\n\nBy the time we meet the 3 Fingers, the forces of madness have learned better. They now know that a willing lord is far better than one who is coerced or tricked.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr3or02o2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0422301895f175b5ca15d1b614c0d46f09cf3523\n\nVyke had armor on because they knew they could not get him to disrobe. That requires trust. Vulnerability. He was not bought into this deal as a full partner. Vyke\u2019s armor is the best proof we have that the full story is being withheld from him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xkgct8gp2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c64082e718ec3cc9c4af1747e1e7d5bb9f76dfa\n\nIt mentions mysterious forces at play. It implies his stated reason for taking the flame was his maiden, so we can assume she was involved in this discussion. Her story is fascinating. It\u2019s difficult to know much for sure, but filenames confirm that she is the dead finger maiden we find in the Church of Inhibition.\n\n[The maiden sits still in her chair near a statue of Marika](https://preview.redd.it/1tl5sbxr2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c55cf170399e2cc66b89371bb5ab9e8140b187e)\n\nVyke went out of his way to save her, yet still failed. He took on a terrible curse, got jailed for it, and yet she ends up dead anyways\u2026in a church of all places.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/st1h0yvx2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2825f557539388f0f8bda33ef812464849cc4fd\n\nCloser inspection shows a bloody maiden holding one of her wrists. We know this is blood because we can use it to progress Varr\u00e9's quest. We can also loot her outfit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tvr58zy2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0db433d9b8aef683c3149d824dfd88f8af8bf2d0\n\nIn this church we also find a Marika statue and a Sacred Tear, a holy chalice similar to our flask. The tear item description also mentions guaranteed blessings of the Erdtree, something echo\u2019d in the finger maiden\u2019s \u2018assurances\u2019. This is a lot of smoke when it comes to the Erdtree having great influence over the fate of Vyke\u2019s maiden.\n\nBut much doubt is cast on the Erdtree\u2019s real power.\n\n&gt;Or did some other force lure him with suggestion? (fingerprint armor)\n\n&gt;Or at least, such was the promise long ago (finger maiden clothing)\n\n&gt;theirs *was once* a certain blessing (sacred tear)\n\nLet us recall that grace is not the only light finger maidens can follow. If Vyke\u2019s finger maiden was like ours, she would have been a follower of the 3 fingers by the time they journeyed to the tomb of the dead god below Lleyndell. More importantly, if she was like Hyetta, she would have pushed Vyke to ascend. Showed him the way.\n\nWhat if this is the false power that lures Vyke? Madness is often mistaken for the power of the Erdtree in many other items. Maybe his maiden hid the fact that she was no longer following the grace of gold, but now sought a different light. There is some reason he is not asked to take off his armor, and ultimately it can be attributed to a lack of trust. But why lie to him in the first place? Maybe it\u2019s because she knew Vyke would never agree to destroy the world. Maybe he had his own Melina, someone keeping him anchored to the current world, no matter how broken.\n\n# He had another love - Ancient Dragon Lansseax\n\nThe key to Vyke\u2019s story is understanding that his finger maiden is not the only one he\u2019s trying to save. The golden order would have him kill an innocent woman he travels with. The flame of frenzy would have him kill the woman he loves. He\u2019s been put in a no-win situation. Ultimately, it destroys him.\n\n[Did Godwyn open the roundtable to dragons and their allies?](https://preview.redd.it/ipm24nl63v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae7720900ce91bcfe53d46331d6a2658e3b22ecd)\n\n# Applying it to Godwyn\n\nLet's revisit key elements of Vyke's story and see what they say about Godwyn.\n\n**Both almost became Elden Lord**\n\nBoth are lord contenders. Vyke for madness, Godwyn for death. Both fail to become aught at all.\n\n&gt;Ahh, Lord Vyke, it seems that you were no lord, after all. Then where is he? Our true Lord, our Lord of Frenzied Flame.\n\n**Both had two maidens**\n\nOne was turned into a puppet and killed herself. For Vyke this is his finger maiden. For Godwyn this is Ranni. One was an ancient dragon. For Vyke this is Lansseax. For Godwyn this is Fortisax.\n\n**Both were part of an expansion of the Roundtable**\n\nWhen Godfrey left, Godwyn was still around. With his father gone, Godwyn would be the first in line to inherit his father's position as commander of the roundtable knights, still ultimately in service of Marika. It\u2019s easy to see how Godwyn would be the first to invite dragons. This could have been an effort to extend status to other peoples, liek the Tarnished, and would have been loathed by the Golden Order diehards.\n\n**Both were imprisoned for associations with factions outside the Golden Order**\n\nVyke harbored doubts about the Golden Order\u2019s willingness to sacrifice young women. I see no reason to think Godwyn couldn\u2019t come to the same conclusion if he was in an arranged marriage. This is made worse by Godwyn &amp; Vyke consorting with ancient dragons, well known competitors of the Golden Order in both religion and area control.\n\nI propose that, despite strong attachment to the Golden Order via the Roundtable, these two heroes could not abide what was asked of them. The cost of being a lord was too high. This disillusionment ends up being exploited by malicious forces, those looking to score political gains and advance their own agendas.\n\nThis happens often in the real world as well. The people being used often take the fall for any political or criminal fallout, which we see ultimately sink Vyke &amp; Godwyn.",

She summons spirit dragons, and also there's a glintstone dragon right in the path of the glintstone key needed to enter Raya Lucaria. And then obviously the Vyke route would be to fight Magma Wyrm Makar and have a sparring match with Lansseax (it's a scripted event that she leaves before being killed), rather than taking the lift. These also happen to be the two demigods on the critical path if someone were to strictly follow the direction of the rays of grace to Leyndell and search in the smallest possible radius for ways to access Raya Lucaria and to find the Ruin Strewn Precipice as an alternative to ascend to Altus Plateau.\n\nBoth locations also have significance to the death of Godwyn, as the Prince of Death's Pustule is found at Stormveil and Ranni who was responsible for Godwyn's death is encountered in Raya Lucaria.",

    "body": "Today I come to you with textual, visual, and symbolic evidence of the primordial form of the Erdtree, the Greattree.\n\n## Textual evidence of the primordial Erdtree aka the Greattree\n\nSeveral item descriptions in game make reference in the English language version to a \"Greattree\" which is implied to be distinct from the golden Erdtree that currently stands. For example, the item descriptions for Deathroot, Map: Deeproot Depths, and Root Resin, respectively, all make distinct references to a \"Greattree\" (Table 1).\n\nThrough these item descriptions we are given enough information to come to several conclusions. First, the vast network of roots we find in-game, particularly within and around catacombs, were originally part of the Greattree before the Erdtree's roots joined with them. Second, the description for Deathroot makes clear that deathroot is spreading _via the Greattree roots, not the Erdtree roots._ Whether this is because the root systems have been disconnected or that the two trees roots still have individual components remains unclear. However, this makes clear that the places we find deathroot, mainly catacombs and graveyards with Tibia Mariners, are directly interacting with the Greattree roots.\n\n| **Table 1. Greattree Item Descriptions** |\n| ---------------------------------------- |\n\n| Item                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Deathroot            | On the night of the dire plot the stolen Rune of Death enabled the first Death of a demigod. Later, the Rune of Death spread across the Lands Between through the underground roots of the Greattree, sprouting in the form of Deathroot.         |\n| Map: Deeproot Depths | At the very depths of the Erdtree's majestic roots lies the source of the Ainsel and the Siofra rivers. Here too begins the network of Greattree roots that spread throughout the Lands Between.                                                  |\n| Root Resin           | The roots of the Greattree were once linked to those of the Erdtree, or so they say, and it is for this reason catacombs are built around Greattree roots. Secreted from the roots of the Greattree. Can also be found near trees on the surface. |\n\nAdditionally, there exists several weapons and armor pieces that refer to a \"primordial\" form of the Erdtree. Per Mirriam-Webster's English dictionary, primordial is defined as: (a) \"first created or developed\"; (b) \"existing in or persisting from the beginning (as of a solar system or universe)\"\"; or (c)\"earliest formed in the growth of an individual or organ.\" [1] However, these item descriptions also include distinct references to the \"crucible of life\" when referring to this primordial state. A crucible is defined as (a) \"a vessel of a very refractory (see refractory entry 1 sense 3) material (such as porcelain) used for melting and calcining a substance that requires a high degree of heat;\" (b) \"a severe test;\" or (c) \"a place or situation in which concentrated forces interact to cause or influence change or development.\" [2] Taking these two pieces of information into consideration, one would come to a logical conclusion that there existed a \"crucible of life\" prior to the birth of the Erdtree and that this crucible of life underwent developmental changes that resulted in the golden Erdtree that exists at present.\n\n| **Table 2. Primordial Erdtree Item Descriptions** |\n| ------------------------------------------------- |\n\n| Item                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Siluria's Tree       | Siluria's Tree, weapon of one of the two honored as foremost among the Crucible Knights.The primordial form of the Erdtree is close in nature to life itself, and this spear, modeled on its crucible, is imbued with ancient holy essence.                                                                    |\n| Crucible Axe Armor   | Armor of the Crucible Knights who served Godfrey, the first Elden Lord. Worn by the knight Ordovis and his men. Holds the power of the crucible of life, the primordial form of the Erdtree.

Holds the power of the crucible of life, the primordial form of the Erdtree. Strengthens Aspects of the Crucible incantations. It is said Devonia quested in search of the Crucible's origin, and departed from the lands of the Erdtree alone. |\n\nBased on this textual evidence, the overarching hypothesis for this study is that **_prior to the Erdtree there existed a distinct Greattree that was also deemed the crucible of life_**. This Greattree represents aspect of the crucible, such as horns, red hair, vitality, and is overall distinguished by red-tinted gold. [3-5]\n\n---\n\n## Oak leaf and vine motif denotes pre-Erdtree tree worship\n\nWithin the world of Elden Ring exists several distinct cultures that are delineated by unique architectural and cultural reliefs. One of the earliest known cultures is that of the Sun Realm, which was once a major regional power but has since waned into near extinction. [6] One motif that has arisen as a potential signifier of the Sun Realm is what will be referred to as the \"oak and vine\" motif [(Figure 1A)](https://i.imgur.com/MeEDPxa.jpeg). This specific motif has been documented in numerous influential Sun Realm locations [(Figure 1B-F)](https://i.imgur.com/MeEDPxa.jpeg) and other potential Sun Realm adjacent cultures [(Figure 1G-H)](https://i.imgur.com/MeEDPxa.jpeg). Additionally, this motif has been documented on individual items within several locations, both in the base game and in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC [(Figure 2)](https://i.imgur.com/Kgj20f0.jpeg).\n\nBased on these documentations of the oak and vine motif, we conclude that this motif is representative of a pre-Erdtree society that put great importance on an oak tree. In conjunction with the item descriptions from the previous section, we further hypothesize that the Greattree was most likely an oak tree and was the center of worship for the pre-Erdtree Sun Realm timeperiod.\n\n---\n\n## Living oak trees in The Lands Between\n\nDespite the overwhelming amount of trees in every region of The Lands Between and the Realm of Shadow, there are only three locations, all within The Lands Between, that have living oak trees [(Figure 3)](https://i.imgur.com/5cKn16F.jpeg). Importantly, these three locations are extremely important to the overall lore of the entire Elden Ring universe. First, the Deeproot Depths contains the Nameless Eternal City and the Prince of Death's Throne. The Nameless Eternal City is widely believed to be a Nox settlement that was banished underground after drawing the ire of the Greater Will. The Prince of Death's Throne is where Godwyn the Golden's body was interred following the Night of the Black Knives. It is here that his body spreads Deathroot through the roots of the Greattree (Table 1). Critically, this location also features Crucible Knight Siluria guarding the stump of an oak tree [(Figure 3A-B)](https://i.imgur.com/5cKn16F.jpeg). When taking a broader view of Deeproot Depths we discovered that many roots of the Greattree persist and are growing new branches [(Figure 3C)](https://i.imgur.com/5cKn16F.jpeg). Interestingly, the entrance to the Prince of Death's Throne requires that one passes under the roots of the Greattree [(Figure 3D)](https://i.imgur.com/5cKn16F.jpeg). The symbolic importance of this requirement will be discussed in future articles.\n\nNext, the city of Leyndell contains a single living oak branch. This oak branch is only found growing from the side of the Leyndell Colosseum [(Figure 4A-B)](https://i.imgur.com/e63rYpX.png), a vestige of the crucible era [7]. Specifically, according to the _Ritual Sword Talisman_, the colosseums were built and used to honor the Erdtree via ritual combat [7]. This item description indicates that the switch from Great Oak Tree to Erdtree most likely was a gradual evolution and not a singular moment in time. This conclusion supports the verbiage of other item descriptions describing the crucible as the primordial Erdtree (Table 1, Table 2) and that the definition of primordial indicates the beginning stages of life [1]. Interestingly, this is not the only depiction of oak within Leyndell. In fact, the oak and vine motif is prominent features on the grand door leading to the entrance of the Erdtree [(Figure 4C)](https://i.imgur.com/e63rYpX.png). However, immediately prior to this door is the Elden Throne platform which is adorned instead with the \"grape and vine\" motif [(Figure 4D)](https://i.imgur.com/e63rYpX.png). We suspect that the grape and vine motif specifically represents the culture that co-opted the Greattree and pushed its evoltion into the current day Erdtree. However, the specifics of this theory will be discussed in a future article.\n\nThe final location containing living oak trees is Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree [(Figure 5)](https://i.imgur.com/HVepwJ9.png). Interestingly, this location features the highest concentration of oak trees in the entire game. They are mostly contained to the lower-level graveyards that contain the followers of rot. Elphael is the new home of Miquella\u2019s Haligtree and thus was most likely chosen as it probably housed a Great Oak tree in the past.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n[1] _Definition of PRIMORDIAL_.

The sun realm stuff isn't even related.\n\nThe section about where oak trees exist is almost completely unrelated to your hypothesis.

    "body": "So, I'm building a grand theory, still tentative but becoming clearer. When I look at all the major forces shaping the Lands Between (the Greater Will, the Three Fingers, Marika, Ranni, Miquella, and even the Elden Ring itself), something never adds up when I try to place any of them at the true center. And yes, I\u2019m aware that Marika and Radagon share the same body. But my point is that neither Marika nor the Greater Will (nor any of the known Outer Gods) feels like the actual structural pivot of the mythos. The only figure who does, at least from the perspective of the connections I\u2019m seeing, is Radagon. He seems to be the defining figure of the One Great, but only through mirroring it. And conceptually, it could be argued that it all starts with the introduction of Demon\u2019s Souls. Is it simply a coincidence that you hear the same melody when facing Radagon in his god form? Because that\u2019s also where it all culminates.\n\nHe stands at the crossroads of every major narrative thread, metaphysical contradiction, and divine influence. And the usual explanation that he was simply a former servant or champion of the Golden Order does not cut it. It feels far too shallow for someone positioned at the heart of so many cosmic strands. In that sense, from a metaphysical standpoint, he seems like the true nexus of the entire cosmology, not just as a god but as a structural idea as well.\n\nI\u2019m working on formalizing this theory but I\u2019m still missing some insights. The main gap is that we know almost nothing about Radagon's true origins. I get the sense that if even a small piece of that background were revealed, all the connections I'm seeing would snap into place. Meanwhile we actually have more information about almost every other major figure, including the Outer Gods and how they define or oppose one another on an ontological level.\n\nAnd there is also another layer I'm trying to understand. I suspect there is a very deeply hidden connection, something that might be truly foundational for both Leyndell and Farum Azula, between Radagon, Placidusax, Gransax, and Bayle. If that link could be clarified in terms of timelines or the placement of certain events, I believe it would define the entire structure of the mythos. But right now, that part is still blurry for me. So I'd appreciate any theories on that front.\n\nAt the moment, my view is that the real key is to understand Radagon fully. If his origin, his nature, and the true depth of his purpose (rather than just the appearance of it) were made clear, the whole Elden Ring cosmology would likely resolve into something much more coherent.\n\nAs a side note, I\u2019m also trying to get some perspectives on how Messmer's placement in the Land of Shadow ties back to Radagon, whether narratively, symbolically, or metaphysically. If anyone has thoughts on that connection, it would help me form a clearer picture. Any input would be appreciated.",

Both are then only spiritual beings - encompassing mind, intellect, faith and the arcane, unshackled by natural/bodily/earthly  physiology - who can then \"ascend\" into a higher realm by absorbing divine energies. \n\nMarika also underwent a process of purification (which may have also killed her...) through the jar rituals of the Hornsent, where she was separated into a cleansed heavenly/spiritual half (Marika) and an impure earthly/bodily half (Radagon). Their natures and the domain of their powers (mental/spiritual vs physical) are reflected by their colours and Soreseals. Since Marika's soul is the actual vessel of the divine energies, and she had control over the four spiritual \"stats\", she could control and shape the divinity inside her into the form of the Elden Ring, reshape its form and properties, as well as later destroy it. \n\nThis obviously left Radagon in a bunch of existential torment, since he was \"born\" as an inherently impure chimera composed of every part of her body and soul Marika discarded to become a god - forever separated from her, yet also bound to her for eternity. He hates himself, he hates his own \"nature\" (both his origins and what he's actually composed of - the \"natural\" parts), and his whole schtick is about becoming as far removed from himself as possible. \n\nThis is why he learns incantations (faith), later moves to Liurnia to master sorceries (intelligence), tries to combine the two in a unified philosophical system, and is completely obsessed with all manners of order, symmetry, purity, balance, divinity, etc. Because they're antithethical to his chaotic earthly nature. He is born as an impure physical \"tool\" of Marika's heavenly \"mind\", and so tries with all his might to become (more like) her - and replace her. \n\nBut his self-hatred is also his eventual downfall: because he hates all natural and chaotic things, he despises and never learns the arcane, which is crucial for control over the Elden Ring. This is why he can't repair it in the end, and poetically ends up as what he fought so hard against his whole life - a mindless weapon,  a physical tool controlled by the intent of higher powers.",

But then the game also gives deathbirds and death rite birds an attack that inflicts deathblight, which presents a serious issue for my previous sentence: deathbirds are ancient, and *looong* predate not just the NoBK, but the entire Age of the Erdtree! So how can they be related to something that supposedly originates so much later than they do?\n\nI've seen various theories over the years that attempt to address this. \"Deathblight actually predates the NoBK.\" \"The deathbirds and/or Death itself have been corrupted.\" etc. But have we considered the possibility that the deathblight the deathbirds inflict ... isn't *actually* deathblight?\n\nDeathbirds and death rite birds have only one attack that inflicts deathblight: a high-pitched screech that also deals damage in a small area. (Their animations look like the screech they perform before their grab might also inflict deathblight, but I was unable to verify whether that animation has a hitbox.) It's *just* their screech: none of their other attacks inflict deathblight, none of their relevant item descriptions mention deathblight, and none of them drop deathroot or are found in deathroot-infested areas.\n\nUndead with a scream that causes death [aren't something FromSoft invented from scratch](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurBansheesAreLouder). What I'm proposing is that the deathbirds' cry has **nothing** to do with Elden Ring's deathblight, but is instead simply a reference to banshees (the modern pop culture version, not the original Celtic bean s\u00eddhe). FromSoft wanted these enemies to have a sonic attack that could instantly kill the player, and so rather than implement an entirely new mechanic just for the deathbirds, they just used the insta-kill mechanic they already had: deathblight.\n\nThis would neatly explain why deathblight and deathroot don't appear **anywhere** in any other deathbird/death rite bird-related lore, or ghostflame lore, or any other ancient undead lore: because deathblight didn't exist when the deathbirds were keepers of Death; it's \"\"\"just\"\"\" a banshee's cry.",

It\u2019s not just the scream needing an insta kill mechanic, the deathbirds are a form of those who live in death. Compare to say, the basilisks, who can spew mists of deathblight but aren\u2019t affected by anti-TWLID mechanics. Same for wormfaces. The game mechanics are drawing a hard line in the sand that states the deathbirds are TWLID. Their visual design matches that too, with the same carving up their body that we see in relics of destined death such as the black knives, the rune of death, or Maliketh\u2019s black blade.\n\nNow, I do think the deathbirds predate deathroot specifically. That just indicates that deathroot is not the only source of TWLID though. Whether deathBLIGHT predates them I dunno, but given that blight refers to diseased plants, it could be that this is again just a term for the version of Death which is sourced from deathroot. And given that they can\u2019t use two different names for the same status effect, they went with deathblight for the English. In Japanese its simply called accumulation of Death.",

For example, they attack Ranni and her followers only after Ranni makes her final moves in her plan to supplant Marika. We also find them just Ordina Liturgical Town locked up in an Evergaol. You could infer that they were locked up trying to assassinate Miquella, who also plans to supplant Marika.\n\nOn top of all this, there is also the dialogue of the Finger Reader in the Deeproot Depths:  \n*\"My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.*  \n*As the first of the demigods to die.*  \n*As a martyr to Destined Death.\"*  \nThis can be read a lot of ways, but I look at as if Marika intended Godwyn to act as a Martyr for Destined Death.\n\nEdit: Oh, and for anyone who might say \"the BKA's can't be silver tears because of Alecto and Tiche being mother and daughter\", silver tears can absolutely \"reproduce\", in a manner of speaking.

That their pursuit of Ranni is 'revenge' for being used in The Night of The Black Knives, as if they have an interest in vengeance to begin with. That they slew those finger maiden crones for any reason other than being given an order to do so.\n\nIn my view, this interpretation misses the intentionally 'formless' characterization of these assassins. The only pieces of information that we've been given about the Black Knives as people are as follows;\n\n\\- They have names (Alecto, for example)\n\n\\- They have a race (Numen)\n\n\\- They have associations (Marika and Ranni)\n\n\\- They act in self preservation (Fleeing the capital)\n\n\\- They slew Godwyn (and presumably others)\n\nThere really isn't anything which dictates that they are individuals with complex motivations and values. That they're still just people who happen to have pieces of the Rune of Death.\n\nThe reality is that the Black Knives are more analogous to the Nazg\u00fbl of The Lord of The Rings series. They are clearly inspired by them. Both creatures are formless humanoids draped in black hoods that cover invisible faces. They both wield unnatural power granted to them by rings (The Rune of Death is a Great Rune, Great Runes are rings of the Elden Ring). They both wield deadly weapons that can inflict damage on one's very soul; that can turn someone into a mindless husk if their affliction pierces deep enough (Godwyn and Frodo). They both act(ed) on the behest of a powerful being without an actual body (Ranni and Sauron).\n\nWhile they aren't exactly 1:1 copies of the Nazg\u00fbl, there's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is another commonality between these two groups of wraiths as well; service to a master. No, Ranni isn't Sauron. Nor is Marika for that matter, but the similarities are hard to ignore when it comes to the immortal foot soldiers that they command. These assassins have been corrupted by the power they wield, pieces of the Elden Ring, and subservience to a greater will was the cost.\n\nI'll leave it at that for now.

Since the Realm of Shadows is where all manner of death wash up, this destruction would bring him to the realm where the Gate of Divinity is housed.\n\nAnother possible interpretation, similar to the last one, is that he used Mohg's blood rituals, not to destroy his body, but to cause enough deaths that Miquella could use that to open a pathway to the Realm of Shadows. If you look around Mohgwyn Palace and the immediate surrounding area, there are piles upon piles of corpses, mostly comprised of Albinaurics. We also later see that the Gate of Divinity is comprised of countless corpses (which, in the DLC trailer, were once fresh before later petrifying over time like what we see in-game). It is possible that Miquella charmed Mohg and directed him to perform his blood rituals by sacrificing Albinaurics and other beings. Since we know a certain amount of ritual is involved in the ascension to godhood, given the Sacred Rite Scroll, it is possible that the Sacred Rite requires mass death in order for an empyrean to ascend (hence the bloody Gate of Divinity in the trailer). This might explain why Albinaurics sought the Haligtree, but none are found in the area proper\u2014they may have been deceived at a grave cost to them.",

    "body": "https://preview.redd.it/0stdde3rdn4g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87bd1a3b6f62c6ecb9fef4982365fee1d82ad4d0\n\nThere is a very particular and intriguing theme in Nightreign of individuals taking on, or being defined by, the identities of others. While no new addition to Elden Ring as a whole, it is far more consistent here, with nearly every Nightfarer connecting to this concept in some way. More than that, though, it is reflective of a critical element of FromSoft\u2019s approach to storytelling, and the relationship between their games.\n\n|\n\nNaturally, considering this idea in the context of the Nightfarers, the first that comes to mind is the Wylder, who uses a Larval Tear to take Heolstor\u2019s place and become the new lumbering, nameless, primordial Nightlord. In order to do so, he fights a Mimic Tear in the Nox city of Noklateo, after having found a crucial scrap of paper inside the Duchess\u2019s Nox-style chest in the Crypt. In a very literal sense, he abandons his original self to take on the identity and form of another, adopting a cursed duty so that the Duchess may survive.\n\nSpeaking of, while the Duchess does not technically take on another person\u2019s identity, she does alternate between two personas: her own, real self, the Duchess, and the more reserved, ceremonial role of the Priestess. She even subdues her natural accent when speaking as the Priestess, taking on a slightly more neutral, formal voice. As the Duchess, she is free to \u201c*get \\[her\\] hands dirty*,\u201d and speak from the heart; as the Priestess, though, she serves a defined role, fulfilling a solemn duty, and is bound to the Roundtable Hold. She is, in essence, living in an identity not truly her own.\n\nOn the note of solemn duty which \u201c*weighs upon the one beholden; not unlike a gnawing curse from which there is no deliverance*,\u201d the Revenant is another immediately obvious case of one individual adopting the identity of another, as the animated doll Daphne not only bears the likeness of the murdered girl Chloe, but initially believes herself to outright be the spirit of Chloe. Daphne\u2019s entire existence is defined by Chloe, in both life and death, as well as the curse of vengeance that drives her forward as the Revenant.\n\nSimilarly, the Raider is revealed, in his own Remembrances, not to be the renowned pirate White Horn, as the Iron Menial mistakenly identifies him, but rather White Horn\u2019s infamous rival/partner, Black Claw. In the wake of White Horn failing to meet his final challenge, having been consumed by the Night, Black Claw donned his rival\u2019s iconic garb, carrying on his legacy until such a day as he could properly lay White Horn\u2019s memory to rest in appropriate fashion.\n\nThe Iron Menial himself is, at one point, impersonated by the Recluse\u2019s old colleague, the Witch of the Wheel. Even once she reveals herself, she adopts the appearance of the Recluse, albeit in slightly different attire, which she leaves to the Recluse after the latter embraces the shadow infant they created, honoring the Witch\u2019s desire for the Night to be accepted and nurtured.\n\nThe Ironeye never technically takes on a new identity, but he does face two figures which bear his own appearance. The first, a \u201cNight Huntsman,\u201d is a version of the Ironeye himself from another world, one who fell to the power of the Night; the second is the traitor who the Ironeye was tasked by the Fellowship to seek out and kill, a fellow assassin known as the Monster, who wears the same attire as the Ironeye, presumably owing to their shared affiliation with the Fellowship. Both literally and symbolically, the Ironeye must kill his own self to mark out his own path, escape the bonds that have restrained him, and indulge in an endless Night of sweet death.\n\nIn stark opposition, the Executor savors every fight out of reverence for life, and stands as a fusion of lives and selves. A spirit-attuned painter from the Land of Reeds, and the Crucible Knight who defied his orders to kill her, melded into one being, resulting in much of the Executor\u2019s story hinging on the gradual process of interrogating and untangling the nature of his present self. He does not take on the identity of another; he is the result of two others taking each other\u2019s identity unto themselves.\n\nFinally, there is the Guardian, the exception to the rule, for he is perhaps only Nightfarer who doesn\u2019t directly interface with the idea of taking on a new identity; however, this, in and of itself, ties into his core theme of standing firm, remaining planted and stoic and unwavering. Indeed, a key part of his story involves him coming to grips with realizing the true identity of someone he thought he knew, highlighting this contrast between his own unswaying nature and the fluid identities of his comrades.\n\n|\n\nThis throughline relates to how the darkness of the Night obscures truth and distinction. The Iron Menial notes how \u201c*Those who fare against the Night find that even their most cherished memories eventually dissipate,*\u201d and the Priestess speaks of how the Night\u2019s \u201c*heavy rains harry \\[the Lands Between\\], threatening to wash away its very history*.\u201d Even in base Elden Ring, one finds the Celestial Dew, stated to be known alternatively as a Night Tear, which washes away the memory of one\u2019s transgressions in the basin of the Church of Vows. Any wrongdoing can be cleansed in this manner, and indeed, the Night\u2019s Tide subsumes all equally; as observed by Libra, ever-obsessed with balance, if \u201c*the night swallows all, then the night is impartial. The night is a thing of fairness, of equanimity.*\u201d And just as all are washed away in the spirit-waters of the Night, as Dark Souls II\u2019s Agdayne tells, \u201c*the embrace of death awaits all things. It is equitable, accepting. We will all, one day, be welcomed by her embrace*.\u201d When all are embraced and consumed in such a way, when all definition and history is eroded, the lines between identities, the point where one ends and another begins, become blurred and unclear.\u00a0\n\nBut another key element that this ties into is that of cycles. Both the Nox and Carians, each closely associated with the powers of night, spirits, magic, and flowing water, emphasize themes of cycles and the reinvention of the self. The rising and setting of one moon to give way to the next; the flow of water into a basin, before flowing out into the next vessel. The concept of self-made, cyclical rebirth, both in a metaphorical sense relating to the passing of power and duty from one generation to the next, and in a literal sense relating to actual transformation and reincarnation.\n\nThe latter is a \u201c*forbidden rite*\u201d and \u201c*grim art*,\u201d in Miriel\u2019s words, yielding a rebirth which is \u201c*as sleep to \\[those dependent upon it\\], and with each awakening, memory fades into oblivion*.\u201d Along this same line, the slumber of St. Trina is symbolized by water lilies whose description states, \u201c*Like a syrupy poison, its nectar lulls the imbiber into sweet, velvety sleep,*\u201d while the concoction crafted by Thiollier in reverent imitation induces true oblivion. Sleep as a whole is described as being \u201c*like a lullaby, or a quagmire*,\u201d one which \u201c*irresistibly draws its victims down*.\u201d Meanwhile, chief among the incredibly few enemies capable of inducing sleep is Nightreign\u2019s enigmatic Augur, the Nightlord known as Maris, Fathom of Night. A great, aquatic being from the stars which wields tidal waves as attacks, its appearance and mechanics closely resemble real jellyfish and the cyclical rebirth-like processes they naturally undergo. The official Twitter post announcing its Everdark Sovereign variant invokes phrases such as \u201c*dreamless abyss*\u201d and \u201c*sunken cradle*,\u201d language all the more noteworthy given Trina\u2019s 1.00 title of \u201cSt. Trina of the Cradlesong.\u201d Even the Grace which restores the Tarnished back to life always does so upon the next morning, never at night. It is abundantly clear that, within the themes of Elden Ring, sleep is alike to death, and awakening a form of rebirth.\n\nIn a similar vein, sorcerers outside Carian purview utilize Primal Glintstones to transfer their souls from one vessel to another, dying in the process. \u201c*The old sorcerers would slice open their hearts with these blades to imbue a primal glintstone with their soul, and thus did they die*.\u201d Sellen's Primal Glintstone bears a fetus-like impression in the center, making the notion of rebirth even more literal. Given she has one to begin with, it can be safely assumed even the body the Tarnished first meets her in is not her original, though there is reason to believe her appearance is yet her own. \u201c*The stars of the night sky once guided fate*,\u201d as it is stated, and repeatedly, the intertwined powers of the stars and the Night are related to the idea of identity and memory flowing from one vessel to another, a necessary cycle if one wishes not to be subsumed and dissolved altogether within the watery depths.\n\nNightreign connects to this even further; every expedition follows the rising and setting of the sun and moon, a cycle of celestial bodies, a waxing and waning. Day gives way to night, which yields to the next day. Each renewal of the cycle is a rebirth, and the legacy of all is preserved through a chain of reinvention. Characters carry on the legacy and memory of the past by adopting the mantle of their predecessors, keeping the cycle going, allowing the waters of one night to flow into the next. All of this ties perfectly into how the Nightfarers are maintaining this fight against the eventide forces of the Night on behalf of their ancestors, bearing the sin-born obligations of the original cutting-gifted tribe; one generation reborn into the next, the will of the elder forging the potential of the younger into a weapon. As put in the Lost Ashes of War\u2019s description: \u201c*Empty ashes of war, devoid of any memories of battle. Unable to apply any kind of affinity in their current state, but can be used by Smithing Master Hewg of the Roundtable Hold to recreate other ashes. Thus does the copy pass into becoming the genuine article.*\u201d\n\n|\n\nBy the Priestess\u2019s words, the Nightfarers are guided by a \u201c*formless master*,\u201d though one of the promotional posts made prior to the game\u2019s release curiously implies the \u201c*formless master*\u201d is, in fact, leading the forces of Night. Such would be fitting, given the Night\u2019s own formless nature, its capacity to subsume and meld with its surroundings, to reflect, to mimic. All of this is expressed particularly overtly in Maris\u2019s expedition description: \u201c*It makes an ocean of its surroundings, that it may blend with whatever life is found, as if in a dream*.\u201d Liquid is formless, taking the shape of its vessel. One thinks easily of the Lands Between\u2019s various divine elements, whose natures and prospective orders are shaped by their vessels, and a cut content item called the Dried Droplet states: \u201c*Power of Night that failed to acquire a host. Droplets that sought to intermingle, and gathered in anticipation of a fitting host's welcome, only to be abandoned.*\u201d The Night is consistently related to the dissolution and melding of liquid essence; the enigmatic Nightfolk also come to mind, those who \u201c*were said to bleed silver long ago*,\u201d as well as the related Mimic Tears, beings of liquid silver who quite directly take on the forms of others.\n\nNightreign even brings back the Mimics of Dark Souls via the Symbol of Avarice, obtained from Libra, a \u201c*goat-headed being who pretends to be a man, said to be able to use a dubious form of alchemy*.\u201d Alchemy is inherently a practice focused on the transformation and ascension of the base into the divine, and indeed Libra is fixated upon the concept that \u201c*for anything to reach a higher plane each side must elevate the other*.\u201d The Night is formless, and thus impartial and equitable in swallowing all. Appropriate, that the Madness-wielding Libra would be drawn to this, for it is very much alike to the Frenzied Flame in that regard. An equitable consumption of all, yet not the conscientious egalitarianism of Goldmask\u2019s orderly philosophy, but rather a thoughtless, chaotic erasure of division. And, as it so happens, the story of the Frenzied Flame features one character taking the form of another, with Yura\u2019s deceased body being possessed by Shabriri. Spirit transferal is fairly common in Elden Ring, but uniquely, this instance does not alter the possessed individual\u2019s visage, or even voice; Shabriri obviously speaks in a very different manner from Yura, but the voice actor remains the same. A figure of the present, subsumed by a will from the past.\n\nWe see this thread carried on in an inverse manner via Ranni, whose doll body is modeled after her mentor, the snowy crone, who can be quite safely inferred to be Renna, elder sister to Rennala and Rellana, completing the Triple Goddess archetype of \u201cmaiden, mother, and crone,\u201d and explaining the \u201cThree Sisters\u201d label for the area Ranni operates out of. The Triple Goddess is associated with phases of the moon, the cyclical shifting of form and duty, the passing of knowledge and purpose from one generation to the next. All rather familiar, and with Ranni, we even see the youth inherit the elder\u2019s very form; unlike most of the cases otherwise seen, though, this is not only entirely volitional, but serves Ranni\u2019s purposes, rather than Renna\u2019s. She may have adopted the knowledge and form of her predecessor, but Ranni\u2019s will and intent remain fully her own, embodying the most balanced and conscientious example of cyclical, cross-generational rebirth across both games, as she weaves her night into being.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q2p2mikdn4g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5296c684c35998391b2e848b60cf87c1e6efff4\n\nOf course, as with most of FromSoft\u2019s work, traces of these ideas can be found in their previous titles. Bloodborne, too, focuses on cyclical nights and the interplay between deathly slumber and waking rebirth. And the very first NPC the Hunter interacts with, the kind doctor Iosefka, is eventually supplanted by an impostor who steals her appearance and home, to further her own research into the Great One known as Formless Oedon, a cosmic god of blood whose namesake rune closely resembles Marika\u2019s own, evocative not only of Nightreign\u2019s \u201c*formless master*,\u201d but of other gods of blood, such as Elden Ring\u2019s Formless Mother and Dark Souls II\u2019s Nahr Alma. Between the deities themselves and their associated families/factions, often the primary means by which players may invade others, a throughline theme exists here, of occult kinship justifying invasive acts of depraved violence. As it happens, the Iosefka impostor ends up impregnated with Oedon\u2019s malformed child, while his implied offspring, the Moon Presence, bears a striking resemblance to the swelling mass seen in the distant sky in Nightreign, noted by some for its own resemblance to certain pregnancy imagery. Further of note, it is viewed from the Spirit Shelter, a place of rest for those of \u201c*no shared station, era, or even purpose*,\u201d a flock \u201c*far from whole, imbalanced and uneven*,\u201d but who are nonetheless bound by a shared will, united in common cause to selflessly protect and preserve life. The direct inverse of the Brotherhood of Blood, Cainhurst Vilebloods, and Mohgwyn Dynasty; deliberate subversion is, itself, a form of reinvention and iteration, and thus even this contrast falls along the trail of recurring themes.\n\nFurther in line with these themes, Dark Souls III sees the conclusion to the story of Dark Sun Gwyndolin. Even from his first appearance in Dark Souls, Gwyndolin is heavily defined by her filial duty to her father, Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight. He is content to remain in the shadows, guiding the Blades of the Darkmoon and orchestrating the perpetuation of Gwyn\u2019s will and legacy. Centuries later, she has taken up leadership of what remains of the godly clan Gwyn established, gathering them in the city of Irithyll, perpetually draped in a chill night, under the crescent light of the Darkmoon, the very same seen in Nightreign\u2019s mysterious variation of the Elden Ring. Even now, however, Gwyndolin still deliberately preserves her father\u2019s legacy; \u201c*Heirdom taketh many forms, indeed*,\u201d as his adoptive younger sister, Yorshka, states, and much like how Gwyndolin\u2019s spiritual successor, Miquella, unintentionally becomes his mother, too naive to avoid her same errors, Gwyndolin too is bound by devotion to the system of power he was born into, a position that affords her the privilege of living as she desires, yet obliges him to sustain the social stratification that renders such a thing a matter of privilege.\n\nUltimately, she has her very being consumed, and his visage stolen, by a formless individual, the wretched and amorphous Aldrich, Saint of the Deep. Though little elaborated upon, the Deep is most manifest at the end of time, when the sky is dominated by an eclipse, bleeding light which takes on a bleached, lusterless hue in a certain ending; an image that is nearly identical to the eclipse insignia of Elden Ring\u2019s Mausoleum Knights and Castle Sol, and to the Primordial Nightlord\u2019s Rune. A grim symbol that overlooks the passing of one age, and the foundation of its successor. Indeed, it feels quite pertinent that Gwyndolin is, perhaps, the FromSoft character most reinvented, with the most spiritual successors; from Gwyndolin herself, to Quella, to Lothric, to the Orphan of Kos, to Miquella, and even now to Gnoster. This concept of spiritual lineage, one generation giving way to the next, which itself is shaped and defined by the legacy of its predecessor, is central to FromSoft\u2019s creative ethos as a whole. It is, truly, a key aspect of their storytelling style.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vg5ueandn4g1.png?width=1878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b917b40a49eda3c33da442bd386e4912a55993e\n\nThe reiteration of certain concepts, or even certain names or designs, exploring different angles of the same core idea; this is how FromSoft weaves their worlds together. Darkmoon Knightess, Lucatiel, and Malenia possess distinct parallels to one another, the enmity of Gough and Kalameet parallels that of Igon and Bayle, and shades of every \u201cLevel-Up Lady\u201d Heroine can be seen in every other. There are countless connections to be drawn across games, and it is exceptionally fitting that Nightreign would be the one to most overtly embody this theme, considering how it, most of all, stands as an homage to FromSoft\u2019s legacy, and the Dark Souls trilogy in particular. Though never explicitly acknowledged, the Priestess\u2019s mention of \u201c*other worlds*\u201d afflicted by the Night implies an explanation for the presence of Dark Souls entities in Limveld, but their inclusion is no arbitrary matter, with deliberate associations between certain figures tying into the overarching themes. Adel is a clear spiritual successor to both the Imperfect and the Gaping Dragon, and so the latter\u2019s presence in Nightreign becomes all the more significant. The Everdark version of Maris is fought using the Storm Ruler, hearkening most of all to the Storm King of Demon\u2019s Souls, an aquatic beast of tremendous size flying through the air. Fulghor\u2019s monstrous arm evokes not only Gundyr specifically, but also Manus, the Cleric Beast, and the Demon of Hatred, forming a prominent series of bosses that all represent the theme of once-noble champions succumbing to base, bestial corruption. Even the Nightfarers\u2019 unlockable Dark Souls skins are matched in accordance with their unique natures and the ways they echo past characters. Each of these connections serves not merely as fanservice, but to inform and recontextualize our reading of these stories.\u00a0\n\nAnd, indeed, these are *our* readings; in various interviews, Hidetaka Miyazaki has often spoken about how much of his creative works are inspired by the experience of growing up not with video games, but rather novels, gamebooks, and TTRPGS, many of which were either intended for older audiences, or written in English, leading him to only halfway understand the plot, yet inspiring him to fill in the gaps with his own imagination. His works are meant to evoke this experience. We are meant to interpret these worlds for ourselves, to co-author the text, to an extent, whether in puzzling out the obscure lore, or making our own choices throughout the games themselves. There is a reason every soulsborne game establishes the player\u2019s version of the story as being but one among countless alternate worlds. Every protagonist is canon, every choice is canon, and every ending is canon, because the story is ours to define, and every story spirals into the next. For what else is a story, but a formless dream, passed from the one who created it to those who would share it, and shaped by the vessels that now bear it?",

    "body": "A speculative analysis of why we have these guys as Night Bosses; + more. \n\nThis selection was arbitrarily selected. \n\nI include the Dark Souls bosses, not because they\u2019re connected, but because there are thematic similarities between them and the Night Lords they fight for, same as the other Night Bosses. \n\n//////////////////\n\nWormface\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nWormfaces are an odd choice for Night Boss since they seem like they would mind their own business. Wormfaces are found in the misty woods of the Altus Plateau as well as an off-road section of Farum Azula, hiding away from attack or judgement (should be noted that Farum Azula\u2019s Deathblight may be present in the city because the city was on land long enough for the contaminate to spread; Farum Azula may\u2019ve lifted off during the Shattering; a Draconic Sentinel and Leyndell Dragon Cult Prayerbook can be found here). The Night does provoke violence as seen with Revenant\u2019s family, though most of the foes in Limveld already have cause to kill us. \n\nAbout Wormfaces themselves, their namesake is pretty obvious, but may be the result of Spontaneous Generation (an archaic belief that pests form from mud and rot) something we see when afflicted with Deathblight as flies burst from our flesh. The Wormfaces are also deformed body-wise and seem to have grown excessively as I have not seen people of the Erdtree grow to such heights; they could be suffering excess growth like Godwyn. They could be an entirely different race of people who transformed. \n\nIt should also be noted that they\u2019re resistant to Holy damage, possibly because Deathblight is a living energy as it sources from Godwyn, an undying body. Holy, to me, must be some kind of life energy as it is emitted by the Elden Beast and the Demigods are all resistant to it (Runes are life and Marika became a God via a mass sacrifice). \n\nThe file name for the Wormfaces is \u201cDeracine\u201d, meaning \u201cuprooted\u201d, perhaps revealing some insight into Miyazaki as he would release a VR game by that title in 2018. It doesn\u2019t explain much however. I think the name means these are dead people who have been resurrected, but unlike Those Who Live In Death, rather I think they\u2019re closer to Godwyn\u2019s affliction, though there is still questions. What makes the difference between afflictions? Those Who Live In Death are in contact with Deathroot which spread through the Erdtree\u2019s roots. The only remaining explanation to me is that these Deracine intentionally infected themselves. \n\nThe minions the Wormfaces summons aren\u2019t too special. They\u2019re rats, slugs, disheveled corpses, and Deathblighted Crabs. \n\nThis boss is summoned in expeditions against Adel, Maris, and Caligo. Why? I\u2019ll ponder some possibilities. \n\nAdel and Caligo are both dragons, different kinds, but similar enough; one is a lightning-wielding Drake and the other is an Ancient Dragon without lightning. Godwyn was a founder of the Capital\u2019s Dragon Cult which worshipped the Ancient Dragons and wielded lightning. The Wormfaces are found in areas that could potentially be associated with Godwyn; the Altus Plateau, which was his home, and Farum Azula, city of the Ancient Dragons; this Godwyn connection could be the (developer-wise) reason they were selected to protect the dragon Night Lords. \n\nMaris is more esoterical as Maris is a sorcerous being, dealing magic and sleep. Magic is residual life energy, as described by Sellen when talking of Glintstone; and as seen with Ghostflame and Dwelling Arrows. Sleep is also associated with death as seen through St. Trina who was dropped into the Coffins Fissure, her nectar (and Thiollier\u2019s potion) dealing death, and her surroundings being melted corpse matter. Water is also associated with death as seen with Godwyn\u2019s fishy design, the waterfall coffins, and Tibia Mariners; the colossal stone coffins are found on a coast and the fissure is below the sea surface. Maris is a spiritual being so I think a deathly Wormface fits for her expedition\u2019s first night in a thematic sense. \n\n/////////////////////////\n\nGaping Dragon\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nAn easy choice and comparative figure to Adel, hence its inclusion on his first nights. The Gaping Dragon has an inverse of Adel\u2019s strength and weakness (it\u2019s immune to poison and weak to lightning, whilst Adel is weakened by poison and resistant to lightning). The Gaping Dragon eats sewage pouring down from Lordran\u2019s cities, so it must be pretty used to poison; its weakness to lightning is a symptom of its heritage as a descendant of Dark Souls\u2019 Ancient Dragons who had scales of stone and lived in the Age before disparity, lightning in that universe being sunlight, a force that distinguishes and changes, thus the Ancient Dragons were weak to it since they embodied stasis and lack of change (think of it like how flowing water washes away rot). \n\nAdel is a Lightning Drake of some kind, unlike anything we\u2019ve seen. The Ancient Dragons of Elden Ring contain Gold in their flesh which allows their conduction of lightning, their flesh being stony as well, but resistant to lightning due to their affinity; the drakes on the other hand are less stony in composition. Bayle is able to conjure lightning and somewhat resembles an Ancient dragon given his stonier flesh; his mountain-bound kin also wield lightning. Adel\u2019s flesh is desiccated and it\u2019s hard to judge its composition. Adel is actually a great mystery to me. Drakes are never referred to as \u201cprehistoric\u201d like the ancients are, so why is Adel a Dino? \n\n(This below paragraph is 64% nonsense, viewer discretion is advised)\n\n(Headcanon I made up because I love Adel and I will make up anything to boast of his primacy) The Crucible causes devolution so perhaps Adel is actually an ancient dragon ancestor and the drakes are just a return to the original form of dragons? (\ud83e\udd26 this literally doesn\u2019t matter and jumps over a wall, not even a hurdle). His lightning is so weird too. Purple? Not gravity\u2026 perhaps gravity adjacent because dragons also have a unique stone-based weakness, drop Smithing Stones, and also conduct electricity; basically, what if dragons are descendants of meteoric beasts? I\u2019ve also pondered purple gold (I\u2019m being for real) which is possible at a nanoscale when gold is compressed and light scatters through it in weird ways\u2026 Night-tinged lightning makes more apparent sense though as Adel is a Night Lord and the Night is very blue and purple. \n\nAnyways, he is prone to vomiting from poison. I suspect it\u2019s due to his excessive eating as he is a gluttonous devourer; poison makes him sick and he is forced to vomit the contents of his stomach to reject it.\n\nBoth dragons are devourers, the Gaping Dragon eating souls and becoming mostly mouth in an effort to eat as much as possible (don\u2019t remember which Miyazaki interview it was said in but it was said). It was influenced by disparity, the power of souls, and hungered after them to obtain more strength, much like the undead of that setting. Adel was starved by the Night as it killed his prey and forced him to adapt to its new world, thus he seems in rough shape, bearing injured skin, excess teeth, and his hunger. He snaps his jaws wide open to get as much of you as he can in a bite. His head has also twisted sideways to accommodate the stature of his new prey, that being men. \n\nMore notes about the Gaping Dragon: It also excessively vomits, this vomit seeming like more of a security measure to force foes away. This vomit also lowers health, similar to Curse in Dark Souls which worsens your frailness as an undead who is already afflicted with a treacherous immortality that will keep you alive even as you rot. The nature of curse is a bit iffy to me, but that\u2019s outside this discussion; it\u2019s caused by dragon relatives like Seath and the basilisks, possibly because they too are closer to an undead state much like the Ancient Dragons of that universe. \n\nGaping Dragon also appears for Maris and Fulghor. Why? Well, both are weak to lightning too so why not? Fulghor also worshipped lightning gods, possibly dragons given that they had an Elden Lord; the Gaping Dragon is from a different universe, but the association still stands. \n\n////////////////////////////\n\nValiant Gargoyle\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nThe Gargoyles are partly made up of flesh, recycled from champions who\u2019ve perished. The matter on their swords is also made up of dead, but is specifically in the form of a wax. They are used by Leyndell, resurrecting their champions as defenders from beyond the grave; they don\u2019t just protect Leyndell but also the Nameless Eternal City below it. \n\nI think it\u2019s used for Adel\u2019s expedition because of its association with Leyndell and thus lightning. \n\nA fun tidbit: The white waters of the Nameless Eternal City, which run from the Erdtree, may be based on Adipocere, a waxy substance formed from fat when moist. This is likely due to the Erdtree\u2019s roots containing corpses. The presence of Gargoyles gives me the connotation this may be the case; the people of Leyndell also coat their doors and windows in wax. \n\nThe Gargoyle also appears for Maris and Fulghor. The deathly association fits for Maris; coffins appear at the river ends of the nameless city. I could also point out the Leyndell/Lightning connection to go with Fulghor, but there is another. Leyndell is a Holy city and the Valiant Gargoyles are warriors. Fulghor too is a warrior and wields the power of Holy in combat, thus a fitting inclusion upon his expeditions. \n\n///////////\n\nFreyja\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nAn arachnid who hails from Dark Souls 2. It is animated by the soul of Seath, a sorcerous lich dragon who sought immortality out of jealousy of his ancient kin. He coated himself in crystals to achieve a fleeting immortality, crystals being stones affected by the First Flame\u2019s disparity as implied by Twinkling Titanite and the various disparate crystals of DS3 (he also trapped his own soul in a crystal to further his undying nature; he used every precaution). Seath died in DS1, but his soul was recycled into the new age thanks to a Chosen Undead who delivered his soul to the Kiln of the First Flame so that the Age of Fire could continue. \n\nFreyja herself appears to be made of stone and bears stalagmites (or fungus) upon her back. She was kept by the Duke of the town of Tseldora, a mining town for the crystal mineral known as Brightstone (called Pyroxene in Japanese). She outgrew her original size at some point and birthed spiders that could control others via parasitism. \n\nThis theme of parasitism is widespread in Miyazaki\u2019s games, a display of his appreciation of nature and its details. Surprisingly, Freyja isn\u2019t a boss for Gnoster. She is a boss for Adel and Caligo though which makes sense given their nature as dragons. \n\nIt should also be noted that one of Seath\u2019s Channelers oversees the Gaping Dragon, so there is a connection between them via Seath\u2019s interests. \n\nCaligo is visually much alike Seath as she is a crystalline dragon. She also coats herself in ice in order to preserve her life in her Everdark form. \n\nShe also appears for Libra\u2019s Nights. In my mind this is because he\u2019s the closest thing we have to a sorcerer in terms of Night Lords, wielding the golden essence of life to deal damage, like how sorcerers wield residual life energy; in Dark Souls Sorcery deals with soul energy, its strongest form utilizing crystals.

Only for us to end up swept up at the Limgrave beach and be saved by Melina, as she is specifically waiting for us there as we are \"the chosen Tarnished.\" This seems to have been cut for development reasons, and instead, we got the weird Chapel start, which was obviously just meant as a screenshot place like the other places from the Four Belfries.\n\nThe reason why both Melina and Morgott are there is that in the 1.00 version of the Limgrave map, Radagon prophesied that the Tarnished would return from Limgrave beach, so they both await their return, with Morgott effectively wanting to preemptively stop the invasion of his realm.\n\n\nA second story element that is important in this context is that in 1.00, Godrick's castle is actually under the control of Morgott's army, as every single 1.00 item description of Godrick's soldiers labels them as Morgott's soldiers. This is probably also part of the \"stopping the invader\" plot, and Godrick had a slightly different part in the plot that we don't really know about. So he is essentially here specifically since it was a castle under his controll at some point and they just kept him here even tho it's not longer his castle. Probably because he is just a pretty good tutorial boss and the lines about wanting to stop the tarnished still make sense in the new context.",

The Greater Will reflects these needs and delivers upon the greater will of sentient consciousness: the Golden Star is sent.\n\nA snowstorm that kills your neighbor is deadly all the same, but surmising it is an angry snow god that can be invoked or quelled is a form of order and control. Scientifically understanding what causes the snowstorm so you can avoid it is a form of order and control. Order IS control, it allows for purpose when the alternative is a confounding absurdity that humankind simply cannot live with.\n\nThe game is chock full of intelligent life looking to a higher power and/or creator to tell it what to do and assign it purpose. To not do so is to accept the absurdity of ones life, suffering, and death when framed in a pre-Enlightenment sense.\n\nOh, you're scared of the unknown? You want Order? Well here's the Elden Ring, have fun.

That any attempt at changing or opposing The Way will inevitably end in suffering and that nothing that opposes the Tao can exist for long in the world; the main way the Tao Te King exemplifies as an upfront to nature is the search for immortality and the unnatural extension of life, for death itself is part of the Way, and all things must inevitably return to the ground.\n\n\nThe Golden Order Fundamentalists study the Elden Ring directly to decipher the mysteries of life within it, thus did they learn of the Laws of Regression and Causality, which are themselves lifted from vague ideas within the Tao Te King (that everything comes from the Tao, and thus one can learn of the Tao by understanding the world and vice versa, and that the Tao pushes everything forward since the beginning of time, in an endless reaction born of one initial motion)\n\n\nIn Shinto beliefs, flowing water is pure, while stagnant water invites Kegare (impurity/spiritual pollution). By halting the flow of life into death, the Golden Order became a stagnant pool, inevitably rotting from within.\n\n\nWhen you apply this lens on the reading of Elden Ring, the folly of it becomes apparent.\n\n\nAs a little extra nugget, one could argue that the Elden Ring mural of Farum Azula doesn't necessarily mean that the Dragons had The Elden Ring or a different configuration of it; if the Elden Ring is Order itself, the mural could easily indicate that the Dragons operate on a deeper understanding of the world's nature, and that the prehistoric world they inhabited was \"fuller\" and \"grander\", lush with concepts and rules that no longer exist and allowed for their currently alien existence (as eternal dragons made of living stone infused with gold). Its a common trope of philosophy, sociology and literature to abscribe to the past a sense of lost glory, an appeal to the nostalgia of something lost to the passage of time (Elden Ring touches on this concept more overtly with items like the Giant Crusher, a massive weapon from the past that modern man can't wield because they have become meek in comparison to their forefathers)\n\n\nThere's also the fact that Placidussax was Elden Lord, indicating a relationship with the Elden Ring, or the concept of it. Whether they were the first species to brandish the Elden Beast, or if they were so tuned to their world they knew and understood its meaning, is open to interpretation, but I personally like this reading on them. It goes well with previous depictions of Dragons in Miyazaki's works: alien prehistoric forces of nature born of a grey world before time was even a concept. A much to different world from our own current existence.",

So my view on Elden ring has some insight from that.\n\nOrder as a concept is almost a vapid pacifism. There is a stagnation as with total order, a grand unified vision, what is the point of innovation? Elden Ring sort of shows this as well. Consider for a moment how many ruins there are in the lands between and land of shadow. Civilizations have literally been built on top of them but culturally, technologically, magically, and in most ways you can think the land does not appear to have advanced in a notable way. \n\nWhile we do not have a concrete date of Marikas rise to power and the length of time she has been in power the game leads us to believe it has been a while. Having the moniker of the Eternal sort of suggests this. Once all conflict was removed and death itself was removed you would figure that the most brilliant minds would have time to innovate or that the ruling class could push them forward. Instead we are shown this weird world where you have a variant of undead and yet all the soldiers, nobles and commoners we see look like ragged zombies themselves. If the tarnished edition adds new lore through items and possible bosses I hope something hints at the birth rate in the lands between because it would be a very interesting piece of data.",

    "score": 8,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "This post is a follow-up to a negatively received post I released to this sub back in September. The central claim of that post was that a copy of Malenia's soul and her memories were stored within her sword, The Hand of Malenia. Recently, the Nightreign DLC has been released and lends even more evidence to this claim in the Balancers of Harmonia boss fight. While this post will talk about how Nightreign builds off of this theory, the vast, vast majority of my evidence will still be found in the canon main Elden Ring game.\n\nSpoilers For the Nightreign DLC Ahead\n\nLet us begin with a quick summary of Malenia\u2019s story. Malenia was born an Empyrean of a single God, curse-laden, along with her brother, Miquella. It is thus that Malenia was afflicted with the rotting sickness, harboring its Outer God within, from the day she was born. Miquella, grieving for his sister\u2019s health, abandoned Golden Order Fundamentalism for the radiance of Unalloyed Gold.\n\n\n\nBut how exactly does Unalloyed Gold assist Malenia? Sage Gowry tells us that \u201cThe rotting sickness erodes one's memory.\u201d Furthermore, the Poison Mist incantation tells us that rot is the cycle of rebirth put into practice. The Juvenile Scholar set tells us that rebirth is \u201cas to sleep, and with each awakening memory fades into oblivion.\u201d\n\n  \nWe find Malenia beside the roots of Haligtree, embraced in richest slumber. As we approach, the camera fixes its gaze upon the Hand of Malenia, and a gust of wind awakens the winged valkyrie. By all previous notions of rebirth and rot learned through Millicent and the rest of the game, Malenia should be little more than a puddle of flesh, melting into the Haligtree. And yet gusts of wind summon the will to awaken, feelings which the Lulling Branch says arise from the depths of one\u2019s heart - the soul.\n\n\n\nSpinning slash, \u201ca skill of dexterous warriors,\u201d can be tied to the Blue Dancer through its being found on the Schimitar, the starting weapon of the Warrior class, who dons the Dancer\u2019s armor. The skills slash foes as the body spins, the memories of the weapon summoning gusts of wind at the wielder's feet. Knight Bernhal teaches us, after all, that Ashes of War are memories of battles past.\n\n\n\nThe Cleanrot Spears wielded by Malenia\u2019s knights are \u201cblessed with an incantation that wards off rot.\u201d According to Jerren, this is an unusual property that only the weapons forged at the Haligtree and those forged by Master Iji share. The Cleanrot Spear also has the ability to \u201crelease the power of a hidden incantation, to erect a palisade of golden spears frontwards.\u201d This sacred phalanx is quite similar to that summoned by Messmer\u2019s assault. The Spear of the Impaler is \u201cremade (cloned) by the forging arts of the shadow realm,\u201d also known as the practice of smithscript. Smithing in the shadow realm was the art of interpreting the script \u201cperceived in the wrinkles of molten steel to imbue weapons with souls.\u201d The Hand of Malenia possesses runes on it that may be the result of such perception. The mark of a bold, meticulous craftsman, who, according to Gowry, \u201cgrasps the essence of life itself.\u201d That essence, of course, being runes, which script is derived from, or another word for. Miquella is also a master of manipulating memory. His charm makes Ansbach and the other followers forget events that may make them prone to violence.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fog that vexed my aging faculties has been lifted. And follies better left forgotten haunt me once again.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother point to consider is what Miquella leaves behind for the Tarnished when we defeat him at the foot of the Gate of Divinity: his memory.\n\n\n\nSo, the Miquella, master craftsman of memory and souls, created a needle to ward off an Outer God. What else wards off the influence of the Outer Gods? The Nox Mirror Helm, found in the Cliffbottom Catacombs, along with Kaiden Sellsword Ashes, behind an illusory wall. These Sellswords originate from the north and can be found prowling the Consecrated Snowfields, the lands of the Haligtree. And what does a mirror do? It creates a copy of a person. It is curious that Iji, a wearer of a mirror helm, is one of the only people in the Lands Between who can forge weapons that resist rot.\n\n\n\nThe diminutive shield on the Cleanrot Spear, which is blessed with the incantation that allows the weapon to produce spectral copies of itself and protect itself against the rot, shares a striking resemblance to the Moon of Nokstella - except for one key difference. If you look closely at the center of the shield, there is a ring of script around the center. What does the Moon of Nokstella increase for the player? Memory. This moon imagery is shared by the Halo Scythe, weapons wielded by the Commanders within Malenia\u2019s army. Now, this is never actually shown, but there is a Golden Crescent Moon which YouTuber Scum Mage Infa discovered with freecam in Ranni\u2019s Ending, which, keeping all the previous bits in mind, means that Miquella likely practices a form of moon magic. Renalla bewitched the Academy wither her moon, and Miquella is a craftsman of \u201cBewitching Branches\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn summary, Miquella\u2019s incantation with Unalloyed Gold comes from runes/script (which he likely learned from his father, Radagon) and makes copies. It is this ability to make a copy over and over again from engraved memory that allows the weapon to restore itself and resist the scarlet rot. Malenia also creates spectral copies of herself in phase two.\n\n\n\nMy claim is that after Malenia removed the needle, a partial copy of Malenia\u2019s soul was within the Hand of Malenia. This copy is not only a result of the script engraved into the weapon, but also of its extensive use by Malenia. Ashes of War are memories of battle that bleed into the weapon. The Lost Ashes of War tells us how the copy passes into the genuine article. A gust of wind from the Hand of Malenia awakens Malenia and restores her memories. Malenia herself is rotten to the core, but the sword cannot rot - the sword remembers.\n\n\n\nWhen I posted this last time (admittedly with less evidence), people were unconvinced and downvoted my post into oblivion. Now, with the release of the Weapon Bequeathed Harmonia (whom I will refer to as Harmonia from now on) boss fight, we may conclusively put this matter to rest.\n\n*\"Some claim to have seen wings when the weapon was raised aloft;\u00a0wings of fierce determination that have never known defeat.\"*\n\nHarmonia was a girl who, to protect her village, prayed to a statue of Malenia, and in was bequeathed to her spear. This spear gives her the power of the memory of Malenia. Given that the spear turned her gaze vacant, the girl who prayed may not be the one in control here. And that is precisely what we see in phase 2.   \n  \nBut before we discuss that, let's talk about some of Harmonia\u2019s moves. She clones not only her weapons but herself. This proves the connection between the incantation of Sacred Phalanx and Malenia\u2019s rot clone attack. Before and with Harmonia\u2019s context, they are very clearly the same magic. In the transition to phase 2, the spear is raised aloft, and Harmonia gains pink-scarlet wings, just like Malenia. But it is not Harmonia who raises the spear, but the spear that raises Harmonia. It drags her into the air, and suddenly she is \u201cherself\u201d again.\n\n\n\nMalenia\u2019s soul, which was in the keeping of her flesh, has fully rotten away by the time we find her, as expected, and seen in characters like Radahn (I theorize it is his weapons and ashes of war that keep him holding the stars; it is all he remembers). But Malenia\u2019s sword summons a gust of wind and restores her memory. The soul is in the sword. Or more accurately, a copy of her soul that has passed into being the genuine article.\n\n  \nThe thematic implications of this will be discussed in my next post.",

It's just something I wanted to pen down as I was trying to find my way back to Limgrave from Liurnia without my map.\n\n**Addendum 1: The Treespear**\n\nI happened to come across the Great Coffin containing the Treespear in Liurnia, on a now-broken bridge leading from Liurnia into Limgrave, directly outside Stormveil Castle.  There is only one Troll guarding it, somewhat aimlessly, as the path leading to the Great Coffin in littered with the bodies of Cuckoo Footsoldiers and Soldiers.\n\nMost of the paths that we see the Great Coffins take are much shorter than what I've illustrated below, though we don't quite know *where* the journey for Great Coffins start. We do know that this Great Coffin is facing the path leading into Limgrave, as the chest containing the Treespear is facing Liurnia. If one follows where the path may lead, the 'path of least resistance' takes the Great Coffin directly to the Gatefront Ruins, where other Great Coffins, containing the Lordsworn's Greatsword the Flail, currently reside. The Greataxe Great Coffin also ends up at these Ruins, though approaching from the opposite side of the Ruins.\n\n[Proposed Path of the Treespear Great Coffin](https://preview.redd.it/dbnh6h9hne4g1.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=494bac1bcbe0c9015b58aea9cad7f8c293deffd4)\n\nThere are some questions that arise from this:\n\n1. **Who was escorting this Great Coffin?** We know that the other Liurnian Great Coffin containing the Carian Knight's Sword was escorted by the Cuckoos. Furthermore, Great Coffins, traditionally, are pulled by two Trolls; only one Troll, free of his chain, remains in the area. However, a Cuckoo escort would be strange, as this particular Great Coffin contains a Treespear, which we know is a weapon \"wielded by knights employed as palace guards in the Royal Capital of Leyndell\". Cuckoos are traditionally locked in conflict with the Carians and potentially with certain individuals from the Raya Lucarian Academy, but there is seemingly no record of interaction between any Leyndell forces and the Cuckoos. Worth noting as well that there is an Erdtree Sentinel roaming Limgrave, though we have no evidence this Erdtree Sentinel is directly loyal to Godrick either, which brings me to my next point.\n2. **Was there a conflict between the Cuckoos and Stormveil?** Its proximity to Stormveil can't be ignored, but at the same time, there is no evidence that the Exiles or Banished Knights were responsible for the slaughter of the Cuckoos. If anything, it almost looks like the Troll may have been responsible by virtue of being the only one alive at the scene. \n3. **When was the bridge destroyed?** It seems odd that the Great Coffin was going down a path that obviously leads off a cliff. If we were to assume this bridge was destroyed in the Shattering, would it not be known if a major highway were destroyed? If we assume that its destruction was more recent, would it have been related to the seeming massacre of the escort?\n\n  \n**Addendum 2: The Flail**\n\nWhile writing the above, I remembered that the Flail is one of those neutral weapons that seems to have no real lore to it. However, the Flail in that Great Coffin did belong to *someone*, even if that someone is a \"nameless fallen warrior\".\n\nReflecting on the two NPCs who actually wield the Flail, an interesting connection emerged:\n\n1. **Brother Corhyn:** While never directly referenced in his dialogue (that I'm aware of), Corhyn is a Prophet. He not only wears the clothes of the Prophets, which describe \"*exiled prophets who foretold misfortune \u2014 and were persecuted and driven from their homes as a result\"*, but his own unique Robe completes the narrative: \"*Even after exile, Corhyn refused to recant his prophecies.\"* The *\"sinister prophecy\"* in question is elaborated on in the Catch Flame incantation: *\"The flame of ruin is anathema to the Erdtree. But prophets sometimes glimpse it within the faith all the same. Sadly when this occurs their sole reward is banishment.\"*\n2. **Adan, Thief of Fire:** Located in the Malefactor's Evergaol in Liurnia, we don't have a complete view of what his life was like prior to his stealing the Flame of the Fell God. What we do know is that the Flame of the Fell God was located in the Guardians' Garrison in the Mountaintops of the Giants. It is possible, given that Adan is a Human NPC that he was once a Flame Guardian, as the Flame Guardians are only really found on the inside of the Garrison on the way to Chief Guardian Arganthy, who was protecting the incantation. However, while Adan literally stole an incantation*,* what exactly he stole may also be interpreted another way. The One-Eyed Shield explains that the *\"malformed one-eyed god\"* was \"o*nce worshipped by the giants\"*, and that *\"this evil deity is believed to have been slain by Queen Marika.*\" However, the existence of the Flame of the Fell God incantation was possibly being protected because its existence proved that \"*the fell god still lurks within the Fire Giants\".* It is unclear who locked Adan in the Evergaol, but we do know Adan was being chased by the Fire Monks from the Mountaintops, through Altus Plateau, all the way to the southwest of Liurnia.\n\nWe veer heavily into **theory** from this point on. While I find it more likely that Adan was a Flame Guardian because of the Flame Guardians being Human NPCs and having easy access to the area where the Flame of the Fell God was stored, there is also the possibility that Adan, like Corhyn, was a Prophet. If so, his visions of the \"flame of ruin\" may be what compelled him to steal the Flame of the Fell God in the first place. His mixed outfit comprising a Fire Monk's Hood and altered Fire Prelate armor may suggest he stole what he could when he ran from the Garrison to protect himself. As far as why he's locked in an Evergaol, perhaps that was an act of self-imprisonment. Maybe that was Adan's idea of preventing his visions of the flame of ruin from ever coming to pass.\n\nThis does nothing to answer *why* Prophets use Flails, but it is interesting that two people tangentially linked to the Cardinal Sin have this one thing in common. It begs the question of whether or not a Prophet of some renown who died in Limgrave was inside of that Great Coffin.",

    "body": "The SotET DLC ends with Miquella's flashback to a promise with Radahn. Many question this, but FromSoft make it very clear that this is a full circle moment with Radahn's armor.  Elden Ring was revealed to the world with a story trailer ending with a fight between Radahn and Malenia, where Malenia whispers something we cannot hear to Radahn, right after breaking her needle and beginning to bloom with rot.\n\nThere has been much speculation about what the vow may have been. Many have thought that the whole thing is contrived BS.  I don't think that FromSoft would highlight a moment like this unless they really liked the story beat though.\n\nOthers have suggested that the vow was that Radahn must be killed in order to be resurrected, but he demanded (or the plan required) that he die in battle.  An issue with this is - why then would they bring armies to a duel and waste so many lives?  This doesn't seem to be in character with Radahn or Miquella/Malenia (as we have reason to doubt that Malenia was bloodthirsty, having spared Godrick when he was at her mercy, for example.)\n\nOther suggest that perhaps Radahn had made the vow, but changed his mind. Or that Miquella made a one sided vow to make Radahn serve him. Or that Radahn made the \"vow\" in jest but Miquella took it super seriously and led a war to make sure it was fulfilled. These theories suggest that when Radahn is brought back, it is only Miquella's evil charms that control him. \n\nI would propose an explanation that fits squarely in the camp of all parties involved having relatively noble intentions, yet the end result was a terrible tragedy - something thematically on point for FromSoft.\n\n\n---\nThe Shattering War has been raging.  Demigods have fought and fell.  It will not end until order can be restored.  Miquella wants as peaceful a resolution as possible, but the fact is that force is needed.  Miquella and Malenia approach Radahn with a truce and an offer - we end this war together, and Radahn will become the Lord, while Miquella becomes the new god.  To do this, they must unite the remains of the Lands Between.\n\nHowever, Radahn added a simple stipulation to this.  The one thing that would truly irk him about allying with Miquella and Malenia is is that Radahn knew of Malenia's reputation.  Of the demigods, everyone knew that Malenia and Radahn were thought to be most powerful - but who was truly the greatest? If they allied, Radahn would never learn who between them was the strongest. \n\nRadahn would join forces and they would pacify the rest of the squabbling throughout the Lands Between, but only if at the conclusion Malenia would duel him.  Miquella and Malenia agreed to this - pacify the Lands Between so that a person could walk from one end to the other, unmolested.  From Oridina to Redmane Castle.  Then Malenia would fight Radahn.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this battle between Malenia and Radahn is indicated to be the last major battle of the Shattering War. Fast forward and their combined forces manage to put down the various unnamed demigods lost to time.  On the way, Malenia defeats Godrick, but leaves him alive.  By the time that Malenia meets with Radahn in CAelid, any other resisting factions have been put down.\n\nNow, two allied armies are gathered in Caelid. There is celebration - finally the wars are over after who knows how long.  But there is a final event before everyone goes home.  The highlight of the celebration is that Radahn and Malenia shall fight to see who is strongest.  Afterward, Radahn will become Miquella's Lord.  They'll have three great runes between them, and can go to Leyndell.\n\nRadahn and Malenia battle, as shown in the Story Trailer for Elden Ring.  It's fierce, but Malenia IS prideful. We know that Millicent says she represents Malenia's pride lost by giving in to the scarlet rot.  It appears Malenia will lose.  Malenia breaks her needle in desperation and releases the rot.  She is rather cocky about it.  She says the vow is fulfilled.\n\nNote that we never see the true conclusion of the fight in the story trailer.  Just an enormous flower blooming from Radahn's back.  By the end of the battles in Caelid, we are told that Malenia was rendered unconscious and must be carried back by Finley.  Radahn will have gone mad and now eats the bodies of friend and foe alike.  Malenia considers herself to still be undefeated, or at least lies to herself about it.  Radahn is still called the strongest demigod by many though.\n\nIt seems that whatever the true outcome, there was likely some debate or confusion about who the victor was.  But what is clear is that neither combatant seems to have clearly won.\n\nNow imagine this from the perspective of the two armies, watching from the sidelines. Two armies, allied under their respective generals/lords. Gathered in celebration, yes.  But it is tentative - everyone else has been defeated. This war has gone on seemingly endlessly - is it truly over?  Can we believe it's over? Will we have peace?\n\nAfter the battle, Malenia's rot is blooming from her.  She must be carried away.  Radahn is now losing his mind. Neither side has a general able to function.\n\nOn Malenia's side, talk among the troops is that Radahn challenged Malenia as a way to try and kill her.  Kill the general, then conquer the army.  He must have done something underhanded!\n\nFrom Radahn's side, did you see what foul sorcery Malenia unleashed? Spectators of the battle are getting sick! It is with that unclean plague that she was rumored to harbor.\n\nOn both sides, the troops are battle hardened. They are used to war. They have lived war for years unending. When they think of peace, they can hardly imagine it.  And now their generals have each been incapacitated.  There is no one to to cool the situation. Tensions run hot and the armies revert to what they know best - war.\n\n\nBattle breaks out and it spreads. It consumes all of Caelid. \n\nPerhaps Radahn and Malenia are still present. Still capable of action. Perhaps they are already fully incapacitated.  It doesn't matter though, as the blaze has started.\n\nPersonally, I think that the two demigods were likely simply weakened at first.  But as the battle broke out, Malenia came to fight once again.  With the needle broken, she bloomed once again.  This led to the massive Aeonian Swamp bloom - and is why an item description speaks of the third bloom being when Malenia arose as Goddess of Rot.  This likely left her weak and comatose. It may have been at this point that she realized the folly of what her pride had wrought, and when Millicent and her sisters budded from her.\n\nBut I don't think the details here are able to be fully known.  In broad strokes, Malenia/Miquella's army allied with Radahn's.  They fought an honorable duel at the end of the Shattering War.  The duel went sidewise, leaving no clear victor and neither individual capable of acting as a leader.  In the fog of war and the uncertainty, the armies reverted to what they knew and began to fight.  Weakened or incapacitated, the leaders could not control their armies.  The end result was a bloody battle that was unnecessary and unintended.",

I don't know anything about it except what's on the wiki but it seems to have some relevance to the Shadow Realm and the warp and wheft imagery.  \n\nhttps://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Weave\n\n&gt;The Shadow Weave's relation to the Weave could be described in many terms. If the Weave could be defined as the natural flows of the energies of the world, the Shadow Weave was the embodiment of the return flows.[5] It was like veins compared to the true Weave's heart, the conductive coating around a bright conduit of energy. It could varyingly be described as leaning on, calling on, being built on, clinging to, feeding off, and echoing the Weave. In short, it was a \"shadow\" of the Weave, and by its very nature as a shadow could never be greater than the Weave itself, although it did prove superior in select areas, such as compulsion and destruction.  \n\n\nMy question is for the RPG people and the DM's out there... Is there more to find in looking at this kind of stuff?",

It perhaps simply got crystalized with her blood, seeping out slowly through the decades and decades that she's been hanging there.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Since NightReign basically confirms that the world of Elden Ring and the Soulsborne universe are tied together in some way\n\n\nExcept really, it doesn't. Nightreign's director made pretty darn clear that the Dark Souls bosses are there to fill up the roster and be fun callbacks, and *not* to have any lore implications to Elden Ring itself. The Nightlord is simply able to somehow bring in characters from a totally different and seperated universe, for convenience's sake, and the nightlord doesn't even exist in Elden Ring.\u00a0\n\n\nBesides that, there is no soulsborne universe. Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne are three distinct universes. Dark Souls was basically made to be a legally distinct, new universe to make a sequel with. Bloodborne at some point seemingly was supposed to have overt references to Demon's Souls, and these were removed, seemingly to seperate it from it's predecessor.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;Maddening the queen could have been the reason Shabriri is the most hated person in history as well\n\n\nFrenzy from Elden Ring and Frenzy from Bloodborne are very much two different things. Of course frenzy/madness is a similar concept, but in Elden Ring it's all associated with this sense of burning anger, of \"how could the world be so unfair!?\". In Bloodborne the madness doesn't come from the juxtaposition of morality with reality, but from the sheer incomprehensibility of the great ones. It's your mind breaking from the juxtaposition between the reality you believed to perceive in your normal life, and the true reality that your brain is perceiving right now.\n\n\nAlso, the blood spike almost certainly entered her while she was already strung up, and this is not something people seem to even know about. Even shabriri probably can't enter the tree. The spike mirrors the sword in Hoarah Loux' stomach, which in turns mirrors the spear stabbed into Jesus' heart after his death on the cross. It makes a lot of sense that the blood spear comes from the same being that has crusified Marika.\n\n\nWhat I don't mean to imply is that there aren't useful patterns and tropes in Miyazaki's games. In the same way that we all have our own meanings and associations with words (depending on language, dialect, personal experience), artists and writers will often have symbols and visual cues that repeat in different works of theirs, and keep a lot of their meanings between works. This absolutely counts for Miyazaki.\n\n\nBuuut I think in this case the resemblance is largely coincidental. More of an art style thing than a symbolic thing.",
