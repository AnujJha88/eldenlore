    "body": "I\u2019ve been thinking about Morgott and how drastically his appearance changes once you defeat him.\n\nWhen we first encounter him, he looms above us. He looms above us - muscular, and imposing. When we encounter him as Margit he jumps to the ground causing it to quake and leaves a crater behind. Even with most of his body hidden under his robes, you can see he\u2019s physically powerful. \n\nBut after you defeat him, he doesn\u2019t just appear to have been defeated\u2026.he looks completely different. He\u2019s suddenly sporting a much smaller frame. His skin is clinging to bare bones. His omen horns are completely gone, his body is clearly diminished, and even his tail has disappeared. He almost doesn\u2019t look like an Omen anymore. \n\nDoes the lore offer any solid explanation for why he changes so drastically?\nCould this be tied to the loss of his Great Rune\u2026 or is something else entirely going on here? \n\nVaatiVidya\u2019s lore video makes the statement  *\u201cIn death, Morgott\u2019s horns disappear. Perhaps it was final mercy from the Erdtree.\u201d*  We know that Morgott is spurned by the Erdtree and devoid of it\u2019s grace, but could the Erdtree have granted him grace in his final moments? Afterall, Morgott did take up the task of protecting the tree when all others had abandoned the duty.\n\nCould this perhaps be FromSoft\u2019s way of revealing the metaphor at the heart of Morgott\u2019s story\u2026 by stripping away his imposing exterior they allow us to see him for what he truly is\u2026not as The Fell Omen or this intimidating demigod\u2026.but as the unfortunate result of being born far too late into a world that once would have revered him.\n\nIn the words of our Lord and Savior VaatiVidya: *\u201cThe other Demigods all had what Morgott was denied from birth - the Erdtree\u2019s grace, a mother and a fate to call their own. But while Morgott was shackled deep below the Earth they threw it all away, so even though he was born a graceless Omen child Morgott tried to be the Erdtree\u2019s protector. He was never loved and should never have learned love, but nevertheless love the Erdtree, he did.\u201d*\n\nI\u2019m really curious to hear what interpretations or theories others have. FromSoft loves revealing just enough to push players to connect the dots, so I feel like there\u2019s probably something deeper happening here that I\u2019m missing.",

He even studied gravity sorcery just so that he could forever ride the horse even after he got too big. Nothing else there. \n\nAnd what was up with Rykard. The game seems to note his aging physique. His faded red hair with a pale silver strand. Even though he's a demigod. He was aging, thats weird. \n\nRanni and Rennalla are technically never seen walking in their real bodies. \n\nEven the so called- Carian weed, who may not be Carian, Sellen, we never actually see her stand in her real body, but maybe im getting too ahead of myself.\n\nWere they cursed?

    "body": "*(thumbnail art credit: notsakku on X)*\n\n&gt;\"Miquella had a good goal, but did things in an evil way.\"\n\n&gt;\"Miquella did nothing wrong, extreme solutions required extreme sacrifice.\"\n\n&gt;\"Radahn consented.\"\n\nI've heard some flavor of all these arguments from lots of people.\n\nKindly Miquella is evil, and always has been. Not a misunderstood good, but an evil misunderstood to be good.\n\nHe had good in him, of course, as most villains do: Love for his family. Positive ideals. A willingness to sacrifice himself for others. He likely believed himself to be good as well, as most villains do. With a natural ability to compel others' affections, he likely never got the chance to see the error in his ways.\n\nRegardless of who the blame lies with, his actual goals were still evil, his methods of achieving them were evil, and there is evidence he sometimes did evil and reckless things for no *good* reason at all. Regardless of intent, he is a villain. A complicated one, yes, but not nearly as morally grey as some people present him to be. \n\nThis is basically a huge essay. I tried to shorten it, but couldn't, so feel free to skip around. Also, I skip most of the Mogh/Ansbach stuff, because I think that's pretty obvious. Most of this, especially later on, is from the base game (and sometimes informed by the DLC).\n\n# Age of Brainwashing: \"If you have known sin...\"\n\nSome have often said *\"Miquella had a righteous goal, but the ends no longer justified the means, that's why he's the villain\".*\n\nHis ends weren't good or righteous at all. The Age of Compassion had a shallow positivity that preyed on peoples' desperation in a miserable world, but beneath the surface, it was a clear death of the soul.\n\nWar, hate, and cruelty would be gone. This *is* a good thing. But *all* conflict, disagreement, struggle, and the healthy resolutions that can follow would be gone as well. We see this in Miquella's circle of followers. Their problems are gone because their *identities* are gone. This is not a group of followers - it is a garden, full of Miquella's unalloyed lilies, actual human-shaped vegetables who immediately begin regressing into unresolved trauma, old loyalties, or outright murderous impulses *the moment* that Miquella's charm is broken.\n\nIf you disagreed with me just now, then you've just exercised one of the most fundamental aspects of our lives - the ability to think for yourself. This is what Miquella wished to strip away.\n\nHis age would have been an endless, dream-like haze without free thought, without emotional introspection, and without personal growth. It would be ruled and controlled by a childish god, and enforced by his overwhelmingly powerful warlord Consort, Radahn.\n\nThose charmed by Miquella are 'alive', but they are not truly *living*. Succumb to his charm, and your lifebar fittingly drops to zero, because you are all but *dead.* This is the Age of Compassion ending.\n\nI believe Melina puts it best.\n\n&gt;*\"However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair... Life endures. Births continue. There is beauty in that, is there not? If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion.\"*\n\n\\- Melina, in reference to the *Frenzied Flame*.\n\nMiquella denied this notion, and is frighteningly similar to the Frenzied Flame in how he advertises it.\n\n&gt;*Become their lord.*  \n*Take their torment, despair.*  \n*Their affliction.*  \n*Every sin, every curse.*  \n*And melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos.*\n\n\\- Hyetta\n\n&gt;*Tarnished one. Aspiring Lord of the old order. If you have known sin, if you grieve for this world, then yield the path forward to us.\u00a0 To I, Miquella, and my promised consort, Radahn.*\n\n&gt;*Let your thoughts be only of love.*\n\n\\- Miquella\n\nBoth the Frenzied Flame, and Miquella, wished to melt all individuality into one unvacillating perspective: Their own. Both of them also attempt to convince us, with nearly identical logic, that this is the right thing to do.\n\nBut that was just his end-game. I'm also claiming that this dangerous behavior isn't new to the DLC. Beneath his extremely charismatic persona, his entire life shows subtle, yet egregious signs of manipulation, hypocrisy, zealous extremism, and selfishness.\n\n# Like mother like son: \"Please die a true death.\"\n\nMiquella's motif, among many, is to be a protector and **champion of the meek**. Remember that description.\n\n&gt;*Who is it that Miquella shall bless, if not the low and the meek?*\n\n\\- Sacred Crown Helm\n\nNo group in Elden Ring is described as more meek, persecuted and leaderless than Those Who Live in Death.\n\nEvidence shows Miquella willingly, and knowingly, contributed to their persecution in the Golden Order, and that he continued to refuse them entry into the Haligtree even after leaving it. I believe St. Trina took pity on the dead, however, and this is one of the reasons Miquella felt he had to cast her away.\n\nNow for the evidence.\n\nWe find Revenants and Putrid Corpses in the Haligtree, but neither of these are actually *Those Who Live in Death*, and are more generic examples of 'Undead' that don't fit the criteria of the latter. The distinction is important, and there is plenty of reason to believe *there is* a real distinction in both cases. I believe Miquella made that distinction too. But why?\n\nLooking into Miquella's past for answers, we can piece together who he was, and why this might be:\n\n* He learned Golden Order Fundamentalism and created several incantations for Radagon, such as Discus of Light. Radagon's own attributed incantations were scholarly pursuits \"in all but name\", demonstrating the laws of Causality and Regression.\n* Miquella created Incantations which seemed to display mastery of these two laws - golden discs fly out, and then regress inward. Unlike Radagon's own spells, however, these are *weapons*.\n* Miquella seemingly also created the Pulley Bow and Pulley Crossbow, described as being \"*made by a certain genius who learned Golden Order fundamentalism.\"* Given that Miquella also created Malenia's arm, a robust and mechanically genius *weapon* in its own right, this description fits perfectly\n* Near the Craftsman Shack on Mt. Gelmir, we see one of Miquella's Lilies. This is where we find the Pulley Crossbow. This hints more strongly that Miquella made these, and that his genius was often used to *create weapons.* This is not very characteristic of one who 'blesses the meek'.\n* Miquella also created Radagon's Rings of Light, likely his final creation for the Fundamentalists, as the description states he eventually abandoned Fundamentalism due to its inability to cure Malenia's scarlet rot.\n\nRadagon's Rings of Light is depicted with a gesture, 'Golden Order Totality', given to us by Goldmask after uncovering the secret of Radagon for him. It symbolizes a deeper understanding of Fundamentalism, one that Miquella certainly had.\n\nThe only other Incantation in the game which has Golden Order Totality depicted on it is Litany of Proper Death.\n\n*(I tried embed images here, but failed x\\_x, I will figure it out later)*\n\nA \"Litany\" is a prayer, and a \"Proper\" death could also be called a \"True\" death.\n\nLooking at yet another weapon of Miquella's creation, the Golden Epitaph, we see this:\n\n&gt;*A sword made to commemorate the death of Godwyn the Golden, first of the demigods to die.*\n\n&gt;*Infused with the* ***humble prayer*** *of a young boy; \"O brother, lord brother, please die a* ***true death***.\"\n\nThe Golden Epitaph *was infused* with a *Litany of Proper Death*, quite literally. They both have the ability to permanently kill Those Who Live in Death. The weapon art also grants a version of Sacred Order, another highly effective tool at killing Those Who Live in Death - and it presents the emblem of the Haligtree upon use. This, then, is a tool of the Haligtree.\n\nBut why did he make this?\n\nMiquella certainly cares deeply for his siblings. We see this through his devotion to Malenia. He wants Godwyn to experience a true death, and it's safe to say that he viewed such a death as a mercy. These are arguably healthy things to feel, in his position.\n\nBut we *can't* kill Godwyn with the Epitaph, or seemingly at all. If the Golden Order could have given Godwyn a true death, they would have. Instead, they left him far below the earth, to fester out of sight.\n\nMiquella could have honored Godwyn in any other way. Why does *a weapon designed to permanently kill Those Who Live in Death* serve to honor his brother's death?\n\nMiquella made this weapon, among others, to support the Fundamentalist Hunters and their persecution of Those Who Live in Death. Much like how Marika's sorrow led to her shattering the Elden Ring soon after Godwyn's death, Miquella's own sorrow had warped into vengeance. It was a vengeance against the meek and the lost, because they reminded him of Godwyn's curse, and never once does he extend his gentle hand to them.\n\nYou may be asking yourself, \"Maybe he doesn't hate them, but simply misunderstands them, or just finds them beyond saving?\"\n\nThis underestimates Miquella's genius. Among the many ways you can describe Miquella, he has three definitive characteristics that disprove any claims of ignorance:\n\n1. His genius understanding of Fundamentalism\n2. His overall intellectual curiosity and genius in other pursuits (Haligtree, Unalloyed Gold, Eclipse, advanced craftsmanship of all sorts, etc.)\n3. His empathy, which seems to be *worshiped* by others.\n\nWe know three characters who can fit each of these descriptions in lesser, yet still extremely obvious ways.\n\n1. Goldmask - Fundamentalist Genius, but not on the level of Miquella, at least not at first.\n2. Sorcerer Rogier - Intellectually curious, motivated to learn more about Godwyn's fate, much like Miquella pursuing the 'Eclipse' in Castle Sol.\n3. Deathbed Companion Fia - Purely empathetic, she self-admits to having a poor grasp of 'these grand affairs', and acts instead out of kindness, regardless of how the world views her.\n\n**All three of them reach the** ***same*** **opinion** on Those Who Live in Death.\n\n&gt;*The noble Goldmask lamented what had become of the hunters.\u00a0How easy it is for learning and learnedness to be reduced to the\u00a0ravings of fanatics;* ***all the good and the great wanted, in their\u00a0foolishness, was an absolute evil to contend with.***\n\n&gt;***Does such a notion exist in the fundamentals of Order?***\n\n\\- Order Healing\n\n&gt;*\"Disturb not the Death of Godwyn, the exalted. We, who humbly live in Death...Live in waiting, to one day welcome our Lord. What right does anyone have to object? Our Lord will rise. The Lord of* ***the many, and the meek.****\"*\n\n\\- Fia\n\n&gt;*\"Fascinating, isn't it? That the Golden Order was pliable enough to* ***absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past.*** *With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair, such adaptability is more important now than ever.\"*\n\n&gt;*\"****These souls have committed no offence.*** ***They have every right to life****, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.\"*\n\n\\- Sorcerer Rogier\n\nAll three of them reached this conclusion: Those Who Live in Death were needlessly persecuted, and no such evil exists within the fundamentals of Order. Our character is able to restore Death within Order, after all. As Pastor Miriel says, **\"All things can be conjoined\".**\n\nHeresy is a contrivance. Miriel, Goldmask, Fia, and Rogier all knew it. Miquella definitely knew it, but he didn't seem to care. He did not welcome Those Who Live in Death into any order - whether Golden or Unalloyed - even while knowing that it was completely possible to include them. He wanted them gone, and with them, the living memory of Godwyn's death which - like him - refuse to truly die.\n\nWhich brings us to St. Trina, who seems far more welcoming to the meek.\n\n# \"I abandon here my love.\"\n\nSt. Trina, associated with sleep, the color purple, reprieve, and love, has a list of things associating her with Those Who Live in Death. We find her in a place crawling with Those Who Live in Death, and her Putrescent Knight is - if not literally one of them - then at least visually representative of their kind in a way no other enemy is.\n\nThe similarities between Trina and death:\n\n&gt;*All tainted flesh eventually becomes putrescence, and this clump of it imbibed St. Trina's nectar, which* ***granted it eternal rest***. *And so it was that putrescence became her knight.*\n\n\\- Putrescent Knight Remembrance\n\n&gt;*A pale purple water lily that is on the verge of wilting.\u00a0Material used for crafting items.\u00a0 Exceedingly rare to find.*\u00a0\n\n&gt;*A symbol of faith in St. Trina.*\u00a0***Dulls the senses, preventing agitation.***\n\n\\- Trina's Lily\n\n&gt;*The favor allows one to forget any aches and pains.* ***In Death, there is only peace, for in Death, there can be no sensation.***\n\n\\- Baldachin's Blessing, from Fia, the death**bed** companion.\n\nThe vividly purple waters near Godwyn, the 'fathomless slumber' Rogier describes when succumbing to Death, and Fia's calming presence as a 'deathbed' companion all strike thematic similarities with Trina.\n\nMany have theorized that Trina offered eternal slumber to those who suffered within Marika's order, one where Destined Death was removed. Sleep, then, was an addictive and comforting escape from life, in a world where one could not fully die.\n\n&gt;T*he sweet oblivion of sleep can become quite the habit.*\n\n\\- St. Trina's Arrow\n\nTrina is not likely to be a direct patron of Those Who Live in Death, but her methods of comfort fit perfectly with them; She did not shy away from their kind, even leaving several of her own lilies in places like Summonwater Village (as a fun side-note, because I'm not sure how reliable this is for lore).\n\nMiquella wanted nothing to do with it.\n\n&gt;*\"I abandon here my love\"*\n\nThe love for himself, the love for others, and *the love he refused to acknowledge.*\n\nIt is fair to say, as some have, that the *main* reason he abandoned Trina was to remove the part of himself that could not stand to see Miquella suffer in godhood. This is probably part of it, if not most of it.\n\nBut, if it was *only* to remove the self-love that prevented his ascent to godhood, then why did he *only* hide his abandoned half?\n\nHe did not hide the usage of Mogh's body, or Radahn's soul, despite how controversial it may have been to his followers.\n\nHe did not hide his discarded and precious Empyrean flesh - in fact, he seemingly left individual pieces of it everywhere, on full display. Ranni left her Empyrean flesh atop a tower that most will never climb, but Miquella made it a show at every single golden cross.\n\nIt's as if he was gloating: *\"Here I leave a single follicle of hair, and with it, abandon my rightful inheritance of the Erdtree. Look how much I'm sacrificing, guys.\"*\n\nAs if with bitter irony, however, he abandons Trina in a place filled with coffins and tombs, crawling with Those Who Live in Death, maybe even out of spite for her insistence to care for them. It is the only piece of himself that he hid from others, and he did so out of shame, knowing deep down that he had irreversibly betrayed his promise of compassion for all.\n\n&gt;*Kindly Miquella... I see you've thrown away... Something you should not have. Under any circumstances. How will you salvation offer...to those who cannot be saved? When you could not even save your other self?*\n\nNot far from the Stone Coffin Fissure, he leaves his Doubt and Vacillation. \"Vacillation\" is a wavering indesiciveness. Without context, one would likely accept that this was him merely abandoning his doubts about godhood.\n\nWith context, we can see a much darker meaning; With Trina's abandonment, he also abandons her ability to stir doubt in him, something he intends to strip away from everyone around him.\n\n# Abandoned Albinaurics, the Violent Haligtree, and Forsaken Castle Sol\n\nThere is other evidence to consider that speaks to Miquella's true nature. I'll be a bit more brief on these points, as there is less information to work with.\n\n**Albinaurics**\n\nLoretta was rumored to be an Albinauric, and wished to venture to the Haligtree to give them a safe haven. Why is it, then, that Loretta is the *only* Albinauric in the Haligtree?\n\nSuspiciously, her weapon's glintstone was replaced with Unalloyed Gold, something closely associated with Miquella's ability to charm others - something that adorns all of his knights and soldiers in the form of an Unalloyed Gold circlet.\n\nAll the other Albinaurics meanwhile, are either protecting, or *inside* of, an Evergaol in Ordina. An Evergaol is *literally* a prison, it's right there in the word. Why? It's not as if the evergaol makes the puzzle any harder - you can just walk into it. For gameplay reasons? The puzzle of Ordina is similar to the puzzle of Sellia, and the latter is not in an Evergaol, so this does not explain it. It seems intentional. Regardless of the truth, Loretta remains the only Albinauric in the Haligtree that we know of.\n\nThe Black Knives, who killed Godwyn, are also there. It's possible that Miquella did not like the Albinaurics very much either, and wanted to keep them at an arm's length from the Haligtree, but still found use in having them defend its entrance.\n\nAlbus and Latenna certainly seem to *think* they were welcome there. But they only have one half of the secret medallion, and when we finally grant it to Latenna, she eventually remarks that her destiny is in fact not with the actual Haligtree after all, but with her sister, Phillia, who is alone at the Apostate Derelict.\n\nSuch helpless people deserve the safety of the Haligtree, especially a person who is implied to be the very source of hope for Latenna's people. And yet, Phillia sits in the cold of an abandoned church.\n\n**Fun side-note:** Earlier, I mentioned the placement of Trina's lilies near some places where the undead walked. There are *tons* of Trina's Lilies in both the Albinauric Village and the Apostate Derelict. There is only *one* of Miquella's Lilies in the Albinauric Village. Exactly one. And there is exactly one Albinauric in Elphael.\n\nYou can find most of Miquella's Lillies in Caelid (around half of which are in Sellia... Radahn-bros?), Liurnia, and Leyndell. I'm not sure there's much to extract here, but I think at least some of their placements provide clues to their respective affections.\n\n**The Haligtree, not so much of a sanctuary**\n\n&gt;*Gauntlets worn by soldiers sworn to the Haligtree.*  \n*Rust-worn and stained through* ***unending conflict***.\n\n\\- Haligtree Soldier Gauntlets\n\nUnending conflict with who? The Golden Order never seems to invade, or even acknowledge, the Haligtree. No Demigod in the Shattering appears to ever go there either, except Mogh who came *once* to steal Miquella and never returned. Even if they are now paranoid of intruders, there is no *invasion* happening.\n\nBallistae-armed deathtraps, a fully armored Loretta, patrolling battlemages, and unalloyed armored knights protect the brace of the Haligtree. There is less resistance on the way to the Elden Throne than Miquella's sanctuary.\n\nWhen the Haligtree soldiers, described as seeing 'unending conflict', are weakened, they willingly *explode* as a final and fanatical defense.\n\n&gt;*Spirits of common soldiers who carry the sacred light. When weakened, they explode to deliver a last-ditch attack.*  \n*This was the bitter revelation discovered by the desperate soldiers who awaited the return of their lord to the rotted Haligtree.*\n\n&gt;***May the flash of our deaths guide Miquella's return.***\n\n\\- Haligtree Soldier Ashes\n\nThis effect comes from a crystal tear, which we can find ourselves.\n\n&gt;*A defective crystal tear which possesses* ***absolutely no medicinal qualities***. *A lesson said to be learned the hard way for some;* ***faith can be a volatile matter, after all.***\n\nIt's fitting that Malenia, Blade of Miquella, also *exploded* into Scarlet Rot when Radahn had weakened her - a final and last-ditch attack meant to kill him, all so her beloved brother could claim his soul.\n\n**Castle Sol's Eclipse**\n\nEarlier, I established my belief that Miquella wanted Godwyn to have a 'true death', one the Golden Order could not give.\n\nAnd so, when Miquella abandoned Fundamentalism, he searched for a new solution - one outside of its tradition.\n\n&gt;*... Ohh great sun! Frigid sun of Sol! Surrender yourself to the eclipse! Grant life to the soulless bones!*\n\n\\- 'Eclipse Spirit' at Castle Sol\n\n&gt;*Lord Miquella, forgive me. The sun has not been swallowed.* *Our prayers were lacking. Your comrade remains soulless...* ***I will never set my eyes upon it now. Your divine Haligtree.***\n\n\\- 'Medallion Spirit' at Castle Sol\n\nI know this is a complicated rabbit-hole of a topic that many people have tried giving a crack at, and it distracts from my point. I may, in the future, make a post or video about my own take on the Eclipse.\n\nBecause Miquella's opinions of Those Who Live in Death are an important point in my post, however, I'll briefly touch on this. I believe the 'Eclipse' is, simply put, the fully restored Cursemark of Death. The Eclipse Shotel, which the above 'Eclipse Spirit' is praying to, looks suspiciously similar to the Halfwheel Cursemark on both Godwyn and Ranni's body.\n\n&gt;*Cursemark carved into the discarded flesh of Ranni the Witch.*  \n*Also known as the half-wheel wound of the centipede.*\n\n&gt;*This cursemark was carved at the moment of Death of the first demigod,*  \n*and should have taken the shape of a circle.*\n\nThe fully restored cursemark - something which, in theory, would have given Godwyn a true death - looks suspiciously like an Eclipse. You can look these up for yourself, if you'd like.\n\nMiquella did not fully understand what happened to Godwyn. How could he? We are the first person to uncover the **full** details of Ranni's conspiracy, something only possible by doing Ranni's questline and being granted the key to the inverted Carian Study Hall. This allows us to access Ranni's true body and retrieve the other halfwheel, the key missing ingredient in this puzzle.\n\nPerhaps he somehow approached the truth, a fragmented idea of this 'Eclipse', but could not finish the puzzle. In either case, Castle Sol fails at the strange task Miquella gave them.\n\n&gt;***I will never set my eyes upon it now.*** *Your Divine Haligtree.*\n\nGiving Castle Sol only *half* of the Secret Medallion, Miquella purposefully coaxes them with an incomplete key to his supposed sanctuary, demanding they *do the impossible* to earn the other half.\n\nHe didn't have to give them a useless *half* of a key - it was a carrot on a stick, and a cruel thing to do. Even as their spirits, *to this day,* continue to desperately pray for the Eclipse and beg Miquella for forgiveness, they are left in the cold without answer.\n\nIf a person sees someone cold and alone on the street, gives them half of a bus ticket to a warm shelter, then says they can have the other half *after* they fully calculate every digit of Pi, are they a kind person? No.\n\n# \n\n# Conclusion - Cursed with eternal youth\n\nKindly Miquella is not *truly* kind, and never really was, even if he tried to be. He is a child with pretty ideas, ideas which, like him, never fully mature. Like some children, he shows selfish and manipulative behavior to get what he wants - a tactic that often works. Children don't really do this consciously, and he likely didn't either.\n\nHe likely lived his entire life never actually thinking what he was doing was wrong, and earnestly did do selfless things that showed his desire to be kind. Still, when you have the natural ability to compel peoples' affections, you likely don't ever hear criticism. All you see is others' adoration of you. Of course, when the world begins to crack, he reaches out his hand to help.\n\nThat's what really makes him so terrifying. His inconsistencies, manipulations of others, and the problems with his Age of Compassion are all invisible to him, because his power makes it invisible to others.

My phrasing is obviously pretty harsh, but this was framed as a response to arguments that say Miquella was only ever kind, had a completely justified goal, and that only his actions on reaching that goal were bad. The Age of Compassion was just as bad as the methods he used to achieve it, and his character in other endeavors showed cracks in that kindness, even if he was not aware of them.\n\nOf course, this is just my theory. You're free to believe in what you want, and I could have missed important things that contradict my arguments. Elden Ring's lore is full of detail and very easy to run wild with.

    "body": "Submit your theories and reasoning, or feel free to debate why I'm wrong. I consider this to be the most likely answer, simply because I find that it makes the most sense and there is more reasoning and links to this conclusion than any other theory I have read (and I have read a lot). I also believe this is why we didn't really get any GEQ lore in the DLC, because there is plenty of evidence in the base game. I would be very happy to be proven wrong and to hear a better theory. \n\n\n\n**Who is the Gloam Eyed Queen (The Queen in Black)?**  \nMarika, and by extension, Melina, who is an offshoot/daughter/reincarnation of Marika.\n\n**When on the timeline did the \"God Hunt\" occur?**   \nShortly before Marika became \"Marika the Eternal\".\n\n**What God/s was hunted?**  \nThe Fell God, spread across the Trolls. The Trolls were skinned and the Fell God was cut out of the Trolls abdomen and replaced with a tablet, which likely contains magical properties that can ward off the Fell Gods influence. The trolls that are not skinned are those who originally betrayed the Fell God and the Fire Giants, and joined Marika and Godfrey's forces during the war. Now they remain as guards to the Forge of the Giants.\n\n**Why did she do this?**  \nOn top of the fact that they were a huge threat to her in general, it is stated that the Fell God also \"*haunts the sagas of the Hornsent*\". We know that Marika had some kind of alliance with the Hornsent, likely because she needed access to the Gate of Divinity. What better way to gain their trust than defeating an enemy that has haunted them for generations.\n\n**How did she do this?**  \nEven before becoming a God, Marika had already amassed great power and many allies. She was also an Empyrean, meaning she had direct ties to Metyr.\n\n**The elephant in the room, Malekith, and why he would have \"defeated\" her.**  \n*\"Marika's sole need of her shadow was a vessel to lock away Destined Death. Even then, she betrayed him.\".* This explains it all since it's well known that Marika wanted to remove death all together. She planned for Malekith to defeat her and seal away Destined Death once she had finished using it's power. She used him, and that is how she betray him.\n\n\n\n**My reasoning and \"evidence\" (I'll try to organise it):**\n\n* The Godskin weapons are large, and that is even made clear in their item description. This likely means that they were used for skinning large creatures, such as the Trolls.\n* The Godskins have \"assimilated\" inhuman physiology, similar to that of the crucible. Assimilate is an interesting word to have been used, meaning that they took in these traits from somewhere. The Furnace Visage depicts the Fell God surrounded in horns, directly linking it to the crucible.\n* Trolls, which are descended from Giants, all have the front of their abdomens carved out. This is the same location where the Fell God sits on the Fire Giant we face. All the trolls, except for those found in the mountain tops, appear to be flayed. The natural skin colour of the Trolls also appears to be white, matching that of the Godskins attire.\n* The Noble Presence incantation mirrors that of the roar of the Trolls and the eruption attack move during the 2nd phase of the Fire Giant. It's description states: \"*Once a sign of the gods' wrath, this incantation became a trophy\u00a0of the Nobles' god hunt.*\"\n* The Godskins Noble Robe has 7 faces in a circle with a sigil at the bottom that looks an awful lot like Metyr, and another symbol in the center. This pattern is the same as the Fell Gods Eye, eight circles surrounding a center circle.\n* The Trolls have golden/yellow eyes, the same as the faces on the Godskin Noble Robes. The Trolls face even share a similar all-round tentacle like feature to these faces.\n* The Furnace Visage is said to depict the Fell God, but the Fell God typically has only one eye. This makes sense though if the Furnace Visage is actually depicting the face of a Troll, which is similar in design.\n* The Godslayer's Seal and the sigil for Black Flame Incantations look a lot like Metyrs head.\n* Blackflame Monk Amon is said to have fled from the Giants Flame when he swore fealty to the Black Flame. Why turn to the Black Flame? Why make this connection between the Fell God/Fire Monks and the Black Flame/GEQ?\n* It is specifically stated that the Fell God was said to have been slain by Marika.\n* The cave where we find the Godskin Swaddling Cloth is right near where the Battle against the Giants took place, and the First Church of Marika.\n* It is stated that the Age of the Erdtree began right after the war against the giants when the Trolls betrayed and fire was vanquished. It makes sense that this happened, Marika gained the trust of the Hornsent and got access to the Gate of Divinity, allowing her to become a God, Marika the Eternal.\n* The frenzied trolls in the snowfields are likely Trolls who managed to escape or were set loose because they were afflicted by frenzy due to the trauma they went through.\n* The trolls with Fur in the mountain tops have fur and guard the forge because they are the Trolls that betray the giants and joined with Marika. People say that they have fur \"because it's cold\". I know it's a game, but evolution doesn't just happen like that, and the other trolls are very clearly skinned/flayed and are not just simply missing their fur.\n* There are only 2-3 trolls in the Shadow of the Erdtree, likely because Marika removed them as part of her plan to gain the trust of the Hornsent.\n* How could Marika have gotten away with all this? Marika is already known to have rewritten the history books and hide her own past. People in the Lands Between know these events happened, but her name has just been removed and replaced with the Gloam Eyed Queen.\n* Rykard speaks \"blasphemy\", likely about Marika's past. There are a lot of dead trolls on the Road to Iniquity that have likely been tortured and interrogated for information, but there is a single Frenzied Troll right outside Volcano Manor. I would guess that this Troll was tortured and revealed the truth about Marika to Rykard and his Inquisitors before succumbing to frenzy and going mad.\n\n\n\nHope you enjoyed",

    "body": "Revisiting this cutscene.  Let's start from the (challengable) position that From put it in there for a specific reason. On the surface, it's pointless because it is re-delivering information already given to us in multiple other places.\n\n**Miquella is asking his brother to make a promise** in person. Not that Radahn took the initiative to make a promise. This is a very important distinction when the one doing the asking demonstrably compels affection/obedience in every single other example we have of him interacting with people directly.\n\nMaybe a bit bold of a theory, but I don't think this is much of a debate.  Miquella asks Radahn for something and Radahn has to do it.  I actually find this to be extremely straightforward even though \"Was Radahn charmed?\" and the nature of Miquella's charming ability have been hotly argued as topics.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID, there are still questions:\n\n* Leda and Dane don't need the charm to be loyal to Miquella, but are affected regardless to make them accepting of the others in the party.  Miquella compelling the vow does not necessarily mean it was entirely against Radahn's wishes.\n* Does Miquella have total control over his ability to compel affection such that it is always a purposeful act, or can it happen inadvertently?\n* **Miquella compelled a promise for an act, not the act itself, which opens the door to all sorts of possibilities, including Radahn trying things to circumvent it.**\n\nRandom related questions:\n\n* Radahn and Jerren made oaths to each other for honorable deaths.  Why was that needed if he already had one with Miquella/Malenia?\n* If Radahn expected to become Miquella's Lord, why did he siege Leyndell and challenge Morgott as part of the Shattering War, something only an aspiring Lord of Marika would need to do?\n* If Radahn is satisfied by his honorable end, why is he ok with being dragged back?\n* Why would Radahn, a man obsessed with war and honorable combat, be interested in lording over an Age of Compassion?\n\nAnsbach is so convinced by the idea that Radahn wouldn't want to return that he assumes it would convince Freyja to side with him in stopping the ritual. But she is too obsessed with Radahn's warlike persona to understand the true implications and is only excited that Radahn can return and keep fighting. Totally oblivious to the fact that the Age he is returning for is to be one lacking merit-based stature and lessened/no conflict. Ansbach only laughs at how stupid Freyja is.\n\nEDIT: Our boy Ansbach would never call someone stupid, and pedantic people have taken issue with my wording.  He's saying he thought she would act a certain way based on provided information and then did the opposite, which is both amusing to him but also sort of expected.  Which some might concisely call 'being stupid'.\n\ntl;dr There are major inconsistencies to this story and what we know about Radahn, I believe it is reasonable to conclude that the vow was against his wishes.",

This would account for the Black Knife Assassins targeting Ranni.\n\nI believe that Ranni was initially a conspirator but double-crossed the others. The Night of Black Knives was designed not merely to kill the scions of the golden lineage, but to resurrect them as Lords for a new Age of Night, with Godwyn as the crucial element.\n\nI believe the Night of Black Knives was a failed three-way ritual. Godwyn's aim was to become a god, specifically a Dragon Lord. According to the 'sacred scroll rites,' this transformation requires the prospective god to die and then be reborn into a new vessel. Godwyn was likely attempting to be reborn in the vessel of a dragon to achieve this Lordship.\n\nThe Nox, using their silver tear experiments, were attempting to create a Lord by crafting flexible vessels capable of absorbing stray souls, one of which might become strong enough for the role. (There\u2019s a controversial theory that suggests Godwyn is a mimic; I disagree, but I do believe some mimic tears were created to potentially house Godwyn's soul.)\n\nGodwyn, I believe, intended to die regardless, pursuing his own agenda. This was separate from the Nox's goals and Ranni's goals. The Nox thwarted Godwyn's plans, only to have their own plans subsequently foiled by Ranni, who was likely allied with the Nox before she acted against them.\n\nThis plot may have involved most of the Carians, including Radagon, as eliminating much of the Golden Lineage would have significantly elevated the status of the Carian children and, by extension, Radagon himself.",

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "I accidentally deleted this post yesterday because Reddit trolled me by making it appear that it double posted. I deleted the duplicate post, and then they both deleted -.- So here it is once again:\n\nWhether the Moons are true Outer Gods or not, has long been up for debate. There\u2019s good evidence to suggest that they could be, and good evidence to suggest they aren\u2019t! But perhaps there is a secret third option; The Moons are attempting to become Outer Gods!\n\nFirst and foremost, I believe that the people of TLB are communicating with the moons through scrying. They have figured out a way to talk to moons, and that is by using a form of water divination. These are what the moon gazing grounds are for. \n\nScrying is essentially staring into a reflective surface to receive divine messages or visions. If you look at the moon gazing grounds, this becomes evident: https://imgur.com/a/jhcdpBJ\n\nThere are multiple item descriptions that mention people \u201cmeeting\u201d moons. I don\u2019t believe that there were moons flying around TLB that only 1 person sees. I think it\u2019s much more likely that their civilization discovered some kind of magic formula for finding and communicating with moon entities. \n\nThere are 4 named moons in Elden Ring. There\u2019s not really a whole lot of information about the moons individually, but when we add all the information together, we start to uncover a cosmic conspiracy! \n\nBlack Moon: It is the lost Moon of the Nox, and it guided many stars. It also possessed extremely powerful magic which essentially was the reason that the Nox worshipped it. I believe that the Black Moon could be the same as the next moon on this list. \n\nDark Moon: This is Rannis moon, It\u2019s described as cold and dark. Another description we get, is it being veiled in occult mystery. The Dark Moon was something to be feared, according to Rannis teacher. Despite her teachers fear of the Dark Moon, Ranni would refuse her teachers warnings, being the rebel she is. Interestingly enough, there are instances where Ranni makes her followers swear their loyalty not to her, but to the Dark Moon itself. \n\nTime and time again, Ranni proclaims that she is following the guidance of the dark moon, and professes it one last time in her Age of Stars cutscene. In this cutscene, we witness a black moon sit just beyond the light, not revealing itself to us until Ranni presents the Elden Ring to it. As the Elden Ring dissipates, we see the moon come into the light, and suck it into its mouth, and it\u2019s also sucking in what appears to be stars, even galaxies! https://imgur.com/a/AevUd1o\n\nThe reason I believe this is the missing moon of the Nox, is because the Nox notoriously failed to ever have a lord and get the Elden Ring. In Rannis ending, we see a black moon sitting just beyond the light, but once Ranni presents the Elden Ring, it shows itself and its worm hole mouth that guides the stars. Just as the Black Moon of the Nox guided the stars. \n\nRennalas Full Moon: There is 1 reference to this in the entire game. And that is the item description for the spell: \u201cQueen Rennala encountered this enchanting moon at a young age, and it would later bewitch the academy.\u201d\n\nIt may not be much to go on, but it does give us some very important insight. The Full Moon literally cast a spell over the people of the academy. This isn\u2019t a small detail, this has implications. \n\nThe final named moon is actually 2 moons, Rellanas Twin Moons. Again not a lot of information outside of the item description: \u201cIn her childhood, she and her older sister Rennala met these moons. Overlapping, as if they were nestled against each other.\u201d \n\nNot much to take away from the item description, but the name of the item does tell us something interesting. Twin Moon. \n\nWhat about the moon that we can actually see in the sky? And the identical one that only appears when you visit the moonlight altar? The Twin Moons are the moons we see in the sky. But the moon in the sky, is also Rannis moon, and didn\u2019t I theorize earlier that Rannis moon is actually the Black moon? \n\nIf Rellanas moon bewitched the academy, how deep does that rabbit hole really go? What if the twin moons, the full moon, the dark moon, and the black moon, are just these 2 moons. They are literally twin moons after all. 4 different moons that are named, each moon has at least 2 distinct sides. \n\nThere\u2019s 1 more instance of the moons having the ability to bewitch people. The Eclipse of Sol. \n\nEclipse Shotel: \u201cIn Sol, the sight of an eclipse inspires a dreadful awe, preventing an onlooker from averting his gaze.\"\n\nSo we know these moons are going around TLB bewitching people, but why? My theory is that they are assimilating with Great Runes, to become an Outer God. \n\nWe see people ascend to Gods, and we see people ascend to celestial bodies. But there\u2019s a higher level to ascend to yet. If you\u2019re a celestial body with godlike powers, maybe the thing that makes you ascend to the level of an Outer God is assimilating with enough Great Runes. \n\nIm not certain if they are literally ascending to a higher plane of existence. But in theory, if you were a celestial god and assimilated with enough great runes, you would have Outer God level powers. \n\nWe do see what seems to be Great Runes inscribed on the Twin Moons already. And Great Runes can hold incredible powers. Individually the Great Runes have the power to shape reality. But when we bring them together and create the Elden Ring, they have the power to create and destroy worlds. \n\nWe see what Marika is capable of when she gets her hands on the Elden Ring, imagine if a hyper intelligent magical moon god got it. Imagine if they went from world to world taking the Elden Rings and got multiple of them! \n\nWas Ranni bewitched? Was she being manipulated? I believe that she was. Just going off of the track record for the rest of the Outer Gods, they\u2019re all manipulating the people of TLB for their own gain. All for the same thing, they\u2019re all after the Elden Ring. \n\nRanni wanted to get rid of order after being forced into it. She saw the evil that Marika brought to the world, and decided that order was the problem, and that life would be better without it. The Moon promised to do that, by taking the Elden Ring away from TLB. \n\nRanni is just a character, she doesn\u2019t have the meta knowledge about the universe that we have. These moons were deeply ingrained in her culture at this point, and they offered her a solution to get rid of order. But the implications of this are far greater than you think. \n\nThink about it. If the Elden Ring could exist in space and still control TLB, why would the Greater Will have to send it to the planet at all? \n\nI don\u2019t think the Greater Will is the all powerful being we make it out to be. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s still essentially the creator god of the universe, but it can only create order with the One Greats universal DNA. This being has its limits, it can\u2019t even directly communicate with the people of TLB. \n\nIf the Elden Ring could exist in space, and it could still be controlled by the people of TLB, it would be. It would be somewhere safe, out of harms way. \n\nThere\u2019s one small and seemingly unimportant story that Fromsoft added to the DLC for absolutely no reason. But there was a reason, the story of Onze brings this theory full circle.\n\nStar-Lined Sword: \u201cSword encrusted with a line of stars fashioned from small pieces of crude glintstone. Weapon of the demi-human swordsmen. When bestowed with this weapon by their queen, the swordsmen swear to find the truth that lies at the end of the procession of the stars.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cProcession of the stars\u201d is a fittingly vague way for Fromsoft to let us know that we are talking about the age of stars ending. First let\u2019s look at the definition of Procession. \n\nProcession means: To move forward in an orderly fashion. \n\nSwordmaster Onze: \u201cOnze, a master swordsman who devoted himself to the Star-Lined Sword, realized that only ruin awaited at the end of the procession of stars, and imprisoned himself in order to forestall it.\u201d\n\nRuin awaits at the end of the procession of stars. \nI don\u2019t know about you, but I certainly don\u2019t think Miyazaki was trying to tell us not to do a conga line with the stars. What \u201corder\u201d means in this context, is the Elden Ring. \n\nWhat this item description is really saying is \u201cSending the Elden Ring to the stars will leave TLB in ruin.\u201d Which is, the Age of Stars ending. \n\nSo yeah, the Moons are pretty fucked.",

There's a reason that his story never came to fruition the way you felt like it should have. There's a reason that despite never engaging us directly, Miquella dies with Radahn. \n\nShadow of the Erdtree is the story of Miquella succumbing to a pre-determined fate - to be ripe with potential, like a bud, but never truly blossom, to wilt. \n\nThe age of compassion was never going to come into existence, and Miquella was always going to die at the Gate of Divinity. It was simply in his nature. \n\nMiquella's affliction, the inseparable fate he shares with Malenia, is the explanation for all of this. A fate he had from the very start that he was not actually freed from upon his ascension, but rather succumbed to. \n\nThe nuance of this affliction of abundance and decay meant that for his entire life, Miquella was eternally \"just on the precipise\" of becoming something greater - almost touching, but never quite. Ripe an abundance of hope and potential, but fated to crumble away. \n\nIf you're interested in more, I think you'll like my video: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/I4j03Av3ieQ?si=LnTik90s0Cc1GxLU\n",

    "body": "Hello, this isn\u2019t going to be very informative, but I would like to let everyone here (that may not) know that the trailer for Nightreign\u2019s DLC has dropped. \n\nI have no real constructive thoughts on this since it blindsided me, but I would like to baselessly talk about the Dreglord and an update in the comments. \n\nShadow of the Erdtree Foes emerge, new locations appear (one of which appears to be a poison fort, like a mini Marais Manor), including a vast Shifting Earth which appeared to host Nox architecture atop itself (as well as below itself like the hanging structures in Nokron). There was also a Trina Lily-ridden cave, a Divine Tower which hosted a Dancing Lion, and a sunken titan body (also a floating ?trunk? full of darkness. \n\nOne of our narrators speaks of the aftermath of the Night. I don\u2019t know what this aftermath is, but I suppose that after all the fighting over the past months there is some sort of reaction, thus resulting in the new characters, settings, and bosses. \n\nOur two new \u201cNight\u201d Lords are an assembly of seeming angels and the Dreglord. The \u201cangels\u201d are seen when fate is mentioned, making me wonder if there is some connection. The texture of their \u201cflesh\u201d reminds me of Malenia\u2019s rot and partly metallic body making me wonder if they\u2019re a recycle of earlier mechanics regarding Malenia (apparently she was supposed to summon her blossom copies as long standing enemies according to the Japanese content creator Chaos Silver Moon in a comment; haven\u2019t seen anyone else mention it). They may be Death\u2019s Envoys, or something to do with the Greater Will given their heavenly appearance. I expect they may be called Valkyries. \n\nMalenia was called a Valkyrie in reference to her wings (which could be seen; figuratively?; even before her revival as a goddess), or perhaps it was in reference for her skill in delivering death? Valkyries carry warriors to the afterlife and the Night has been delivering death for some time. \n\nAlso, the ultimate ends of one\u2019s fate is death, so perhaps that line is relevant? \n\nThe Dreglord is my curiosity. He is filthy, vibrant, and we only get a glance from afar. Whatever he is, I want to see. Dregs are remnants, waste, somewhat referenced in Dark Souls 3 when the world is coming to an end. Not that there\u2019s an immediate connection, but his power looks like the summoning of waste. The Night has misconstrued time and place, like what happens at the end of Dark Souls 3. Dreg can also refer to sediment at the bottom of something, fitting into a theme of unwellness as the Japanese culture has a conception of something called kegare, spiritual filth, which is often associated with stagnant water as it doesn\u2019t flow, thus never filtering out, filling with dregs. In Dark Souls time has \u201cstopped\u201d (not convoluted) and the darkness and consequences of timelessness built up. I wonder, if anything, what may\u2019ve built up to create a Dreglord? Time, darkness, death?",

She is Marika, but she is still Marika's daughter and a sister to Messmer, the same way Millicent is a daughter to Malenia and has multiple siblings.\n\n\n\n**The Albinaurics**\n\nThe Black Knife assassins \"*were all women, and rumored to be Numen who had close ties with Marika herself*\". They appear to have long blonde hair when exposed. They fight the exact same way as Melina, and wield very similar weapons. Their actions and placement in the Lands Between suggest that they work for and are loyal to Marika. I believe Marika worked with or used the Nox to create artificial life and clone herself.\n\nGeneration 1: The first attempt, they succeeded in creating artificial life, but their legs didn't work and they couldn't reproduce. Interestingly, the women are all blonde and resemble Marika, and their connection to wolves can possibly be linked to the shrine in Malekiths arena.\n\nGeneration 2: The second attempt, which failed because they all turned out as frog-like abominations.\n\nGeneration 3: The third attempt, which succeeded. Silver Tears were born. They could take any form and they could reproduce (as seen from the Silver Tears \"dripping\" from the Silver Tear Ball in Nokstella.\n\nBonus: Both generation 1 and 2 Albinaurics can be found imprisoned, tortured and being interrogated at Mt Gelmir.

She can recall Marika's echoes at Sites of Grace. She knows Marika's secret tree incantation. No one else in the game, other than Torrent, seems to know she exists. She also questions what it means to be born of a mother... why?\n\nAlecto was the ringleader of the Black Knife Assassins. We receive Tiche when she is defeated, who is her daughter that is a spirit (hint hint). Millicent and her siblings are offshoots of Malenia. Daughters, but also just reincarnations of Malenia herself (hint hint).\n\nIt may not be a simple explanation, but Melina being birthed/created in a similar fashion to a Silver Tear explains pretty much everything about her.",

    "score": 209,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "The title basically states it. This theory of mine is addressing what the Seduction and Betrayal that was spoken in the DLC Story Trailer is.\n\n# What We Know\n\n*\u201cMiquella the Kind spoke of the beginning. The seduction. And the betrayal. An affair from which Gold arose. And so too was Shadow born. What followed was a war unseen. One that could never be put to song. A purge without Grace or honour. The tyranny of Messmer's flame. And so Kindly Miquella would abandon everything. His golden flesh, his blinding strength. Even his fate.\u201d*\n\nThe seduction and the betrayal are mentioned only once here. Just like almost everything involving what happened during Marika's ascension is never mentioned in the actual game. However there is enough to make a theory based on it.\n\nNow we know that the seduction and the betrayal most likely occurred during Marika's ascension or was involved with it as this event predates the creation of gold. Lets for now ignore the seduction and focus on the betrayal bit.\n\n# The Betrayal Of The Crusade\n\nNow we do know that Marika did betray the Hornsent at some point in the form of Messmer's crusade.\n\n*\u201cThe Erdtree is my peoples' enemy\u2014By Marika long betray'd, set aflame.\u201d*\n\n*\"Take vengeance upon Messmer and his lot. They who betrayed us, aye, they who burned us... Let them face in thy wrath their just deserts.\u201d*\n\nHowever this presents a problem, from everything we know the crusade happened long after Marika became a god as Messmer and Gaius are considered to be elder brothers to Radahn(Which means that Radahn at the minimum knew Messmer during his time at Sellia).\n\nThere is nothing in the game, concrete anyways, that references any other betrayal by Marika. From all that we can tell, the Erdtree and the Hornsent were on friendly terms. The only thing that would make sense is if Marika deceived the Hornsent to become a god, however this has no evidence. Not even the Hornsent Grandam ever accuses Marika of such. Not once is there a piece of lore that ever references(besides a vague statue that could mean anything) any betrayal on Marika\u2019s behalf during the ascension. No, the only betrayal to the Hornsent by Marika was the crusade.\n\n# Miquella's Atonement\n\nGoing off of Leda's words, Miquella's abandonment of everything is due to the aforementioned events. Thankfully, we do know quite a bit about Miquella's whole abandonment thing:\n\n*\"Miquella set off for the tower enshrouded by shadow, abandoning everything\u2014his golden flesh, his blinding strength, even his fate. All in an effort to bury the original sin. To embrace the whole of it, and be reborn as a new god.\"*\n\n*\"Ever-young Miquella saw things for what they were. He knew that his bloodline was tainted. His roots mired in madness. A tragedy if ever there was one. That he would feel compelled to renounce everything. When the blame... lay squarely with the mother.\"*\n\n*\"You must kill Miquella... Grant him forgiveness.\"*\n\n*\"Well, I am much obliged. I can hardly believe it, he's divested himself of his very eye\u2026 Tender Miquella's eye is no mere morsel of flesh. It is a vessel of soaring grace. Proof of his Empyrean lineage. I wonder, does Miquella the Kind intend to sever his very birthright? His fate as a child of the Erdtree?\"*\n\n\n\nMiquella wanted to renounce his very flesh as a form of atonement for the sin created by his mother. Only then could he embrace the whole of it and be reborn as a new god, free of the grace of gold.\n\nNow the Original Sin is something that is quite interesting. Its important to note that the japanese for this is better translated as \u2018Causality\u2019 unlike the mention of the original sin in Messmer\u2019s remembrance. However I do believe that they are both talking of the same sin as the creation of causality was the sin created long ago.\n\n# The Causality of Gold &amp; Shadow\n\nThe affair that happened at the beginning created Gold. However, Shadow was created too. Gold in this case is the gold of Order, the Scadutree is the opposite. The chaotic crucible that thrives outside of Order.\n\n*\"The Scadutree is the shadow of the Erdtree.*  \n*Born of dark notions that bear no sense of Order, that twist and bend its stock, rendering it brittle.\"*\n\nThe Scadutree(The main part of the tree) exists because the lands of the tower still are influenced by the crucible(Most likely because the Crucible originated from this land as Devonia\u2019s items suggest). The Land of Shadow falls outside of the Erdtrees golden light. For the crucible has long lost its strength under the golden light of the Erdtree.\n\n*\"The Crucible has a particularly strong influence on the beasts of the realm of shadow, causing many to grow horns despite the characteristics of their species(DLC)\"*\n\n*\"This horn began to sprout on a beast that typically bears no horn. Perhaps it's a vestige of the primordial crucible(BASE GAME).\"*\n\nThere is also another interesting parallel with the Sword of light and the Sword of Darkness. The Sword of Lights' light is unswerving(meaning not changing) and the Sword of Darkness is made of wandering coils of darkness that creates vortices and eddies.\n\nThis division in the natural order of the world is the Original Sin, the causality created by Marika at the beginning. This division is why Miquella seeks to abandon everything(His blinding strength, his golden flesh, and the fate of a child of the Erdtree). For in order to embrace everything, he must no longer be a part of the causality. He refuses to be a god with the same causality affecting him, so it must go before he becomes a god.\n\n\n\n# SEDUCTION AND BETRAYAL\n\nNow we finally get to the main part of this. I propose that the seduction and the betrayal is not an act that Marika did, but an act done towards Marika by the fingers.\n\n\"*I fear that you have borne witness to the whole of it. The conceits \u2013 the hypocrisy \u2013 of the world built upon the Erdtree. The follies of men. Their bitter suffering. Is there no hope for redemption? The answer, sadly, is clear. There never was any hope. They were each of them defective. Unhinged, from the start. Marika herself. And the fingers that guided her. And this is what troubles me. No matter our efforts, if the roots are rotten, \u2026then we have little recourse.\"*\n\nWhile Ymir is a bit biased, the important part of this is that the fingers are what guided her. This makes sense as there is a finger ruin near the shaman village. The fingers are what lead her to godhood, a godhood that Marika came to regret.\n\n\n\n\u201c*Secret incantation of Queen Marika.*  \n*Only the kindness of gold, without Order.*\n\n*Creates a small, illusory Erdtree that continuously restores the HP of nearby allies.*\n\n*Marika bathed the village of her home in gold,*  \n*knowing full well that there was no one to heal.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cA braid of golden hair, cut loose. Queen Marika's offering to the Grandmother.*\n\n*Boosts holy damage negation by the utmost.*\n\n*What was her prayer? Her wish, her confession? There is no one left to answer, and Marika never returned home again.\u201d*\n\n\n\nThe kindness of gold, without Order. An incantation that Marika made in secret and is in the form of the Erdtree(Which does imply that Marika came here after the Erdtree began). It is here that Marika cut off a braid of hair and gave her wish, her confession, her prayer to the Grandmother and left her home to never return. The reason for this: She realized she had been tricked and deceived right from the start.\n\n\u201c*I declare mine intent,*\n\n*to search the depths of the Golden Order.*\n\n*Through understanding of the proper way,*\n\n*our faith, our grace, is increased.*\n\n*Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past.*\n\n*My comrades;*\n\n*why must ye falter?\"*\n\n\n\n*\"Then, after thy death,*\n\n*I will give back what I once claimed.*\n\n*Return to the Lands Between, \u00a0wage war,*\n\n*and brandish the Elden Ring.\"*\n\n\n\n*\"O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.\"*\n\n\n\n*\"Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness. The road is yet long. A God is not easily felled. But one day, without fail, you will have your wish. So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika...\"*\n\n\n\n*\"Are you having second thoughts? Might I have a word, then?*  \n*Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.*  \n*The demigods. And their god.*  \n*If you remain loyal to your calling, then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,*  \n*I will never cease to smith your weapons. Until you have one to slay a god.\"*\n\n\n\nMarika eventually came to conspire against the Golden Order, even disdaining it as she insults Radagon for his unyielding loyalty. She forsook her first lord and his men, chained a misbegotten to the Roundtable Hold, and shattered the very source of her godhood. All of it done to kill the very incarnation of Order.\n\nFor Marika finally realized the truth, that divinity was a cage and she has walked into a cage even worse. For she is no true god. She is merely a puppet held on the strings of a beast that has always been in charge for it is the very Elden Ring itself. This was why she ordered her lord and his men to brandish the Elden Ring once they returned. For in slaying the Elden Beast, Order can only be defined by the wielder. No more can the vassal of the Greater Will define Order.\n\nThis is the seduction and the betrayal. Marika was seduced by the fingers with the offering of divinity. A divinity that can bless all with a golden kindness. No more is divinity defined by something one is birthed with. Now divinity would be certain, observable. A giant golden tree that spills forth blessings for all, forever. That is the promise of Marika the Eternal. An eternal age of golden kindness.  \n  \nHowever, this wasn't to last. For the Erdtree ran dry and blessing no longer spilled forth and the blessed grace of gold became restrained by Order. Those not accepted by Order were forsaken, including three of her own children. I wonder if Order itself was what caused the Age of Plenty to end. After all, the Scadutree that isn't affected by Order still has golden sap.  \n\nThe betrayal in the end was that everything was for naught. Her children having to be hidden away from the world, her people that were assumingly killed for divine tower(Tree people at Enir-illim and that shaman flesh melds harmoniously well), and her age filled with stagnancy. That age of kindness was desecrated all in the name of Order.\n\nSo Marika, her faith broken, stand before the Grandmother and offers a braid of Golden Hair. For she, like her son, offers a part of her golden self as atonement. For everything she has sacrificed for, was for nothing in the end. And from that moment onward, all she desired was to right the world, to atone the only way she could. To create the end that should not be.\n\nI wonder if Miquella knew of all of this, for that might be why he forsook his other half and his doubts. So that he would not become like his mother, and realize the truth that St. Trina knew: \"*Godhood would be Miquella's prison. A caged divinity... is beyond saving.\"*\n\nTLDR:  \nThe Seduction and the Betrayal was the Fingers tricking Marika into becoming a god for her age of kindness, only for her to be nothing more than a vessel for the Elden Beast\u2019s Order.\n\n",

But this post isn\u2019t about that, however the concept at its most basic core is important for understanding this theory. \n\nYou only need to understand 1 thing. Ancient things were big and strong, but generally speaking they got smaller and weaker over time.\n\nUnderstanding the link between the Hornsent and the Ancestral followers will also explain some of the mysterious similarities between the Nox and the Hornsent, and it may explain the biggest secret of them all, Elden John. \n\nLet\u2019s kick this off with the most obvious connection between the Hornsent and the Ancestral Followers, physical features: https://imgur.com/a/t733Ovi\n\nI theorize that Ancestral Followers are to Hornsent, what Neandrathals are to Humans. The species that we most evolved from and eventually took over. \n\nBoth the Hornsent and the Ancestral Followers have white hair, they wear it with and without braids. They\u2019re both pale skinned, and most importantly they both have a fascination with horns. \n\nWhile the Ancestral Followers do not have real horns anymore, their gods do: https://imgur.com/a/aYJepZu \n\nYou can see that on the Ancestral Spirit the horns are becoming smaller compared to the Hornsents Divine Beast. This, plus the missing horns on the Ancestral Followers heads, tells us that either this society is dying, or that they weren\u2019t as deep into Crucible worship as the Hornsent would go on to be. I think the answer is both.\n\nWe do have some evidence to suggest that their society is failing. We actually find them in the over world, found guarding a minor Erdtree. Pushed to desperation they came above ground to look for solace in the thing that forced them underground to begin with.\n\nI believe their desperation is because Marika turned the Crucible into the Erdtree, and removed destined death. As a result of Marikas actions, all things crucible and death related got either completely destroyed or severely weakened.\n\nWe can also see that they do have some crucible imagery in their society but nothing like the Hornsent do: https://imgur.com/a/aOw3F7z \n\nThe hair, the golden spiral headband, and the horns all suggest that they were aware on some level of the Crucible; But the lack of it in their architecture and artwork tells us that they were not as fixated on the same aspects of it as the Hornsent are, or more likely; They weren\u2019t as knowledgeable about it. \n\nAs we all know, the Crucible became the Erdtree. The old world became the modern world. In that way, Ancestral Followers could be compared to Amish people, but in a more extreme way. \n\nAs the Amish folk do not live with electricity, the Ancestral Followers did not believe in using letters, or using metal. They rejected the new and chose to live secluded underground, still clinging on to the old ways. \u201cThe ancestral followers keep their distance from the Erdtree, awaiting new buds. They are certain to sprout from their very flesh, and indeed, their souls.\u201d\n\nThere is clearly a physical connection between the Hornsent and the Ancestral Followers, but the connection goes beyond the physical realm.\n\nGhostflame was a huge deal during the early days of the Hornsents age of the Crucible. It was one of many accepted forms of death, and it\u2019s the only one important for this theory. \n\nGhostflame is exactly what it sounds likes, a magic/spirit fire. It\u2019s also referred to as \u201cspirit flame\u201d and does magic damage instead of fire.\n\nThe Ancestral Followers also use magic/spirit fire that they call \u201cspirit vapor.\u201d Using the skull of a young ancestral spirit, they spew forth a blue vapor that deals magic damage, but exists in the physical form of fire. \n\nGiven all of the evidence, I believe that the Ancestral Followers are the progenitor species of  the Rauh, and therefore the Hornsent. And I believe Elden John may be the gap between the Ancestral Followers and the Rauh civilization. If you\u2019ve seen Elden John in his full glory, you would see that he\u2019s not quite a human. https://imgur.com/a/gg54W29\n\nElden John is clearly part tree, and I think that\u2019s what made him so important. I believe he may have been an ancient Empyrean. \"Verdigris is said to be the gift of an outer god.\u201d What this tells us, is that the Rauh civilization was at a turning point, and the Outer Gods were helping them make that turn. \n\nThey refused to use metal work and advanced language, but needed to use them to get to the next level of technology, consciousness, and magical ability. Essentially their own beliefs were holding them back from the next step in their cultural evolution. \u201cA spirit of the horned folk who eschew letters and metalworking.\u201d \n\nWe know Outer Gods use Empyreans to create Gods, to spread their message and influence. People certainly aren\u2019t out here making hundreds of giant stone statues of somebody that isn\u2019t a god, and given how massive the civilization became, I\u2019d say they were successful. \n\nWhat Elden John represents is the evolution of Mysticism into Paganism. Elden John is kinda being compared to Moses with his stone tablet, marking the beginning of a new age of spirituality. \n\nThe Ancestral Followers are the people of the Rauh civilization that rejected change. Like I said, they are an extreme example of the Amish. They chose the old world. They kept their brutish forms, and their indigenous lifestyle, because the new world went against their spiritual beliefs.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to show us that these Ancestral Followers are directly connected to the Rauh civilization, but there is enough. First is the most obvious, you really only find them in Rauh ruins. \n\nThe second, and real reason, is that interacting with the architecture is an important part of their religious rituals. The fires of each pillar must be lit in order to awaken the Ancestral Spirit. These pillars exist in all Rauh like ruins, so this isn\u2019t new construction the ancestral followers added in: https://imgur.com/a/c92Yb42\n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, we can get to the good part.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the connection between the Hornsent and Ancestral Followers, but what if I told you that this connection leads to the answers of a much deeper mystery? It answers the question of why the Nox and the Hornsent are connected. \n\nAt some point during the Ancestral Followers time in isolation, they were greeted by unexpected refugees from the surface. The Nox. \n\nI imagine the first meeting went something like this: \n\n\u201cSo you guys just like, chose to live down here this whole time huh? Not really my first choice, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers am I right ahahaha\u201d The Noxman looked back at his fellow peoples who were also engaged in snide laughter, and went for a few fist bumps. \n\nThe Ancestral Follower looked around at the ruined civilization, and remembered a day when they were once a great people. It\u2019s said that this Ancestral Follower would later go on to lead a march out of the underground. \n\nOk enough with my nonsense let\u2019s get back to real lore. \n\nI think it\u2019s pretty obvious that the Nox and the Ancestral Followers were in contact. It\u2019s impossible to get to certain Nox cities without going through Ancestral territory. And we even see the Nox using Rauh gravestones: https://imgur.com/a/UsBwWhp\n\nSo with that said, the similarities between Nox civilization and Hornsent civilization is incredibly striking. Let\u2019s explore some of those similarities. \n\nFirst the architecture: https://imgur.com/a/LIdW2WL\n\nUnderground Nox cities and Enir-Ilim are the only places that have this style. There\u2019s nowhere else above ground besides Enir-Ilim that are built this way.\n\nSecond, the symbols they use in their artwork, while unique to their own civilizations, is ultimately extremely similar: https://imgur.com/a/LBZIsYZ\n\nWhile it is a stretch to say these civilizations have the same artwork, there is still clearly some huge similarities here. \n\nThird, they both have similarly sized giant people: https://imgur.com/a/UrFBXlW\n\nThere\u2019s no other civilizations that have these random giant people, outside of literal giants. Just the Nox and the Hornsent.\n\nFourth, both civilizations turned massive amounts of people into stone: https://imgur.com/a/WwGwUeo\n\nThis one kinda speaks for itself. The only other place like you find bodies like this is Rykards arena, mixed in with the bodies of snakes. \n\nLast but not least, the fifth similarity between the two civilizations is their obsession with creating artificial life to reach divinity. \n\nThe Nox have had many experiments with trying to create divinity. The silver tears, albinaurics, dragon kin etc.\n\nThe Hornsents ancestors in Rauh were more into the whole artificial life thing than they were, but the Hornsent would do some experimenting of their own with the creation of the living jars. \n\nDespite all of these similarities between the Nox and the Hornsent, their religions and cultures were totally different from one another.\n\nWhile the Nox wanted to bring about the age of stars, the Hornsent were more than content with maintaining their own status quo. \n\nDespite all of these similarities, the only link we have between these 2 civilizations that could explain the strange connection, is the Ancestral Followers presence. \n\nPerhaps there were truths within that ancient mysticism that could only be understood by a more advanced society. Truths that the Hornsent would discover through many generations of an evolving religion, and the highly intelligent Nox would discover through their exposure to this strange people. \n\nSo what do you think? Did the Hornsent really descend from the Ancestral Followers, or is it all just a coincidence?",

This grace appears right after Ranni  gets the finger slayer blade and directs us to Ranni to aid in the slaying of her bayful shadow and allowing her to kill her two fingers. \n\nSo I was wondering who do you think is guiding us to the Age of Stars and why you think they are doing it?\n\nPersonally I think its the greater will do it. For the greater will seems to be about the \"will to live\" and what better expression of the that is a age where everyone gets to decide their own fate without the meddling of God's. This is why their is no grace leading down to the sewers of Lendyll and towards the frenzy flame and why the grace guides us to defeat Miquella. Both  ages are antithetical to the \"will to live\" and make your own  choices where as Rannis age brings that in abundance. ",

    "body": "Still a tentative theory but I've come to believe that the victims of the Godslayer Hunt may not have been the Children of Marika at all. (Or at least of this generation.)\n\nOne of the most notable traits of the Godslayers is their stark white robes which are made out of the skinned hides of their victims.\n\n\"Robe made by sewing together patches of smooth skin.\"\n~ Godskin Apostle Robe\n\n\"Robe made by sewing together patches of smooth skin.\nSubcutaneous fat makes it plump and soft.\nWorn by Godskin Nobles, known for their seven-face aprons.\"\n~ Godskin Noble Robe\n\n\"Sacred cloth of the Godskin Apostles, made from supple skin sewn together.\"\n~ Godskin Swaddling Cloth\n\nBut whose skin exactly? Who were these Gods and what can we learn about them? \n\nOf all the dialogue concerning Gods in game there is one group who stands out specifically. The Oracle Envoys.\n\n\"Spirits of a monstrous band of musicians who employ sacred arts. It is said that when Oracle Envoys appear, playing their pipes, they do so to herald the arrival of a new god, or age.\"\n~ Oracle Envoy Ashes\n\nThey're specifically mentioned as heralds of new Gods, their ages and presumably their orders. If that is the case that means that they've been around for a LOOOOOOOOONG time, and if so that means that they no doubt would have some at least extant connections to the Godskins.\n\nLo and behold there exists an item which might explain the nature of the Gods in question.\n\n\"Thin strips of flesh taken from a bloodless creature.\"\n~ Strips of White Flesh\n\nThis item specifically is dropped by the Oracle Envoys who themselves seem to have a quite ivory palor. \n\nSo essentially what does that tell us? A couple things actually. The best item of reference to compare it would be its counterpart the Sliver of Meat item.\n\n\"A slice of thinly carved beast flesh.\"\n~ Sliver of Meat\n\nIf we go based off my theory this would establish the Gods in question as:\n\n- White Skinned\n- Bloodless\n- And non-beast\n\nThe last part I assume based not only off of the description but the types of enemies that drop the Strips of White Flesh item.\n\nIf you look at the wiki collectively the common vein amongst most of its carriers are aquatic creatures such as crabs and lobsters. To me this indicates that these Gods may have had origins that lay in the water.\n\nAnother vein of thought that supports this is the mention of an alternative evolutionary process mentioned in the Godskin gear:\n\n\"Nobles are the most ancient apostles\nwho are said to have assimilated inhuman physiology.\"\n~ Godskin Noble Robe\n\nThe assimilation of inhuman physiology is what grabs me here. It might even imply that the Gods they hunted evolved based off an alternative to the Crucible, and the Crucibles creation may have been a more recent occurrence. This is also supported considering that the Godskins were known for borrowing other things from the Gods they hunted as well:\n\n\"Once a sign of the gods' wrath, this incantation became a trophy of the Nobles' god hunt.\"\n~ Noble Presence\n\nIt's quite possible that the Godskins white skin itself came about as a result of their hunt.\n\nI'd love to know everyone's thoughts! Happy Lore Hunting!!!",

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "Elden ring is a very dense game when it comes to lore, requiring knowledge several unrelated fields to make sense of what the hell is happening. The communtiy contains botanists, historians, even people carbon dating textures and datamining for gold.\n\nElden ring remains special among souls games because in older games like DS1 you had the basic gist of things if you watched a few cutscenes, listened to frampt and kaathe and read a few item descriptions. In elden ring we can't even agree what characters want or even who they are, and one of the biggest culprits of that is Marika and the shattering. But after the revelations of the DLC and multiple runs and time to reflect and analyse i believe i reached a conclusion.\n\nI personally believe that elden ring is a story about Marika's introspection post grief, done through the lens of extention of grace to tarnished that echo aspects of her and her history. Letting them compete to find the best solution forward in shadow of the failure of the golden order.\n\nAgreeing on motive :\n\nThe trailer for the game's story narrated by Ranni paints a simple and pretty clear picture of the events leading to the shattering. There is a sea of theories about wether Marika was in on the plan, wasn't, wanted to kill Godwyn to ready him for godhood but ranni fiddled with the black knives, some even stipulate Godwyn was cursed even before his death... Quite frankly none of it matters in the context of this discussion, as Ranni herself, the self proclaimed architect of the death of Godwyn, with her magical fingerprints all over the blade as confirmed by Rogier, says in that trailer that the death of Godwyn, and his incomplete state drove Marika to the brink which led to the shattering and later on the extention of grace to the tarnished.\n\nThe shattering and the summoning of the mending rune tarnished can be therefore understood as an attempt from Marika to see the world from an external perspective, retrace her path and relearn the world, herself and the order post grief seeing that every tarnished introduced in the cutscene has aspects of her and her history within them, and hopefully find a path forward.\n\nHorah loux is her first husband and ruler of the age of plenty, Fia is a reviled witch that engages in life giving and a deep desire for motherhood, Goldmask as an introspective sage seeking the depths of the order, dung eater as a walking talking manifestation of the terror inflicted upon her by the hornsent and inflicted by her upon them and Gideon as a knowledge seeker from without, not within.\n\nBeginning with Fia, as she represents the earliest stage of life of Marika as a shaman girl, reviled and hunted down by the dominant culture, and the idea of the divine feminine. Both Marika and Fia have deep ties to the concept of motherhood, absorbing life to give life, sending heroes to do their bidding and having their headquarters be bedchambers with stacks of books next to them. \n\nMesopotamia and the divine feminin : \n\nElden ring takes inspiration from world history and mythology but nowhere is it clearer than with the hornsent, godfrey and Marika.\n\nEnir illim clearly is inspired by bab illim or Babylon in English. Midra's wife Nanaya is named after a fertility godess and speculated aspect of Ishtar/Inanna. Godfrey's history even has many similarities to the story of Gilgamesh, an ancient warrior king always depicted with a lion as his greatest friend. But it appears the roles were flipped as the regal king is Serosh and the barbarian beast is Horah loux, in the story of Gilgamesh Enkidu lives as one with the beasts naked similar to Horah loux, the highlanders and the badlanders and shunning exess adornment to hunt bears and beasts to be filled with the extacy of the wild.\n\nIn that story, Enkidu terrorises the hunters and the animals until a priestess of Ishtar names Shamhat literally, and without any exaggeration screws him into submission for seven days and seven nights straight. In many ancient cultures masculinity is seen as explosive, wild, tumultuous and destructive. But with the introduction of feminity and the transformative capabilities of it, through sexual intercourse that negative energy is not only removed but transformed into life and a gateway for civilization through the stifling of beastly urges clearing the mind. These prostitutes even engaged in ritualistic intercourse to bless harvests. Of course Enkidu later hears about Gilgamesh and fights him to the near death and from that is born the first bromance in recorded history. Add to that Gilgamesh was fond of axes as weapons, being his and Enkidu's weapon of choice against the divine beast humbaba that lived in a forest of ancient trees.\n\nThis act fits the depiction of the hornsent grandam of Marika as a wanton strumpet and the first sin as a seduction and then a betrayal through the banishment of Godfrey.\n\nFia herself is very coded as a ritualistic prostitute and divine mother gathering life from champions to give a noble a second life, done through flesh and please don't tell me i'm the only one that sees this, there was a thousand ways Miyazaki could depict a baldachin but he chose the one with a clit and curtains.\n\nThe tarnished can be seen here a second Godfrey serving the role of being the father of Godwyn's second life. Like Godfrey was to his first life. \n\nMarika, through the guidance of grace offered to Fia and offered to the tarnished leading towards Fia accepts death, those who live in death and Godwyn within her as the symbolic pillar of the principle of life within death in the golden order and a renewed love for motherhood. Fia even declares the tarnished her greatest champion giving him her radiant blessing and that being a deathbed companion was her greatest joy.\n\nThis is a repost and a light revision to a removed post, the second is Goldmask and the third will be the dung eater. Gonna be morbid as hell and possibly longer, oof.",

Some of their attacks appear to do holy damage as well, although I'm not certain of that.\n\nThe expedition description reads:\n\n\"Seven valkyries clad in white armor. These servants of the heavens restore the balance of the world by wielding heroic weapons that purify chaos.\n\nBut even heroines must one day sleep, so why not retire early to the annals of history?\"\n\n  \nThe use of weapons, of course, typically involves death, even when it's for a noble cause. I know that \"of the heavens\" could set them apart from the concept of \"death's gentle envoys\", but I would like to point out that Maliketh's Black Blade (the weapon and the incantation), and the Black Knife weapons do holy damage, and things related to Black Flame scale on Faith.\n\nAnd the description in the relic received for defeating them reads:\n\n&gt;!A tiny farming village was besieged by bandits, who proceeded to ravage both its plots and people.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!A young village girl, seeking help, dashed into the forest, where she prayed to the statue of a protective deity that held a weapon raised overhead.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!By the end the village was steeped in red and settled in silence. The village girl, drenched in blood, stood with a vacant stare and a heroic weapon in her grip.!&lt;\n\nThe mention of &gt;!\"a protective deity that held a weapon raised overhead\"!&lt; doesn't sound like any statues we've seen of Marika, and could potentially fall under the category of \"pagan beliefs\" in the Lands Between. Radagon does strike a pose like this in the intro to his boss fight, but not in his statues.\n\n  \nI understand that the nature of Nightreign's canon is shaky, but the Winged Scythe's description has always felt like a bit of an odd inclusion in Elden Ring, and this kind of lore expansion seems like a perfect fit for Nightreign. The game's director has more or less said directly that it's designed to exist in Elden Ring's world without unraveling its central plot and mysteries. I'm curious what others think though.",

    "body": "The Maiden featured on the Shield of the Guilty seems to reveal a bit about the nature of the Lands Between and it's existence as a possible Penal Colony.\n\nThe shield description reads...\n\n\"Shield made to venerate a maiden whose eyes were crushed by Briars of Sin before being reborn in these lands.\n\nVenerating the repose of the soul, this shield boosts focus. The briars can be used to attack foes.\"\n\nRight away we are given several subjects...\n\n- The Briars of Sin\n- Rebirth\n- Repose of the Soul\n\nWhat does this tell us? Well essentially it seems that the Briar Maiden was guilty of something as Briars of Sin reveals:\n\n\"The guilty, their eyes gouged by thorns, lived in eternal darkness. There, they discovered the blood star.\"\n\nThis tells us right away that the Briar Maiden was guilty of something. For this she had her eyes crushed by deadly briars and was forced to walk in Eternal Darkness for her punishment. \n\nThe presence of Briars also possibly implies a strong connection to the Blood Star, and by possible extension the Mother of Truth.\n\nAside from her these thorns are featured on the Fire Guardian Hags likely signifying some connection between these two parties. In essence it begs the question of what are these hags guilty of if they are in-service to the Erdtree. A service that would ensure the trees longevity at that.\n\nAnother possessor of Briars is Elemer, another foreigner who himself was set to be Executed if it weren't for the downfall of House Marais. His gear reads:\n\n\"Battered iron armor from a foreign land. Worn by Elemer of the Briar. \n\nThe winding, rusted iron briars are a mark of the guilty and typically indicate a sentence of death.\n\nElemer murdered numerous instructors and merchants, and was known as the Bell Bearing Hunter.\"\n\n~ Briar Armor\n\nAgain we are given the subjects of Guilt and foreign nature. Elemer originates from Eochaid and for whatever reason he was sent ALL THE WAY to TLB to be killed. Why? \n\nThat brings us to our next subjects: Rebirth and Repose of the Soul.\n\nWhy The Lands Between, ignoring differences between real world and fictional economies, wouldn't it cost less to just kill them where they were? Perhaps but what if I told you that they were only meant to die to be reborn. If we take another look at the Shield of the Guilty it mentions:\n\n\"Shield made to venerate a maiden whose eyes were crushed by Briars of Sin before being reborn in these lands.\"\n\nTo be reborn requires that one must have died, even in the metaphorical sense, something must be given up to gain new shape. And it's not like this isn't something that happens regularly in TLB anyways:\n\n\"Amber egg clutched by Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon.\nGreat Rune of unborn demigods.\n\nPerfects those who have been born anew.\n\nChildren born anew by Rennala are all frail and short-lived. Imperfect beings, each and all.\"\n\nIn fact we see a myriad of enemies in game that have seemingly been reborn into new shapes, and each of them drops a Larval Tear. In order for this rebirth to be reversed the creatures new form in question must be destroyed to revert. This loosely connects Death with transformation (though then again it could just be a gameplay mech who knows?)\n\nBut lastly to tie this together are the Lulling Branch and the Slumbering Egg:\n\n\"In the midst of drowsiness, there is the will to awaken.\nFeelings that rise from the depths of one's heart.\"\n\n\"Owl eggs that will never hatch.\nMaterial used for crafting items.\n\nPrized as a symbol of the most sublime slumber.\"\n\nIn previous posts I detail how Sleep the domain of St. Trina has intrinsic connections to Death which is countered by Miquella's connection to \"waking,\" birth or what we collectively reference as Nascency.\n\nBoth operate as vital parts of the cycle of rebirth one bringing rest to that which whithers, while the other rouses new life into birth.\n\nThe line mentioned on the shield:\n\n\"Venerating the repose of the soul\"\n\nSeems to be referencing directly the subject mentioned prior in the same item: the concept of being reborn.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nI have come to believe that The Lands Between are indeed a Penal Colony, and that Death only washes ashore to be reborn in some way into a more suitable acceptable form. This would even seem to explain the Zealotry of the Hornsent who Jar the Maidens.\n\nIf indeed there was some history here wherein the Shaman would, \"Make Saints of Criminals\" who came there, we can kinda see how it could turn for the worst if perhaps a previous order had been deposed.\n\nTo put it concisely: The Shaman were likely Wardens of a Penal Colony, and could have suffered a disaster which tilted the scales out of their favor making the prison (rehabilitation center?) they once held into cage for themselves. \n\nTo back this up I'll even bring up the Winged Scythe:\n\n\"According to pagan belief, white-winged maidens are said to be Death's gentle envoys.\"\n\nThe Deathbirds were no doubt Matriarchal given that their only progenitor given was a Mother in the Form of the Twinbirds. And here we are again given the concept of femininity in connection with Death. The Deathbed companions, Trina, Melina, Ranni and even Malenia and her Valkyries. \n\nThis paints a picture of a Matriarchal Land of Death and if one has Death, it must be tempered and defined by Life. The line connecting these two? Rebirth. \n\nBonus bit:\n\nThis got me to thinking also about the Biblical Story of Cain and Abel. To keep it short, after Cain kills his Brother he is sent to \"The Land of Nod,\" and if one where to look up the meaning of the word Numen/Numina:\n\n\"Etymologically, the word means \"a nod of the head\", here referring to a deity as it were \"nodding\", or making its will or its presence known.\"\n\nJust some food for thought. I hope you enjoyed my ramblings, please lmk what you think! And as always HAPPY LORE HUNTING!!!",

    "body": "It's said that Shabriri committed the crime of slander and as punishment had his eyes gouged out. Most people just accept that at face value, believing that Shabriri is, as he himself claims to be, chaos incarnate and using that as an excuse to not have to explain any of the things he does or says because \"he's chaotic\" but this line of thinking has never sat right with me. For one thing villains never start out as villains, certainly not in these games. There is no character in any one of these games that is pure evil, so it's crazy to me that everyone would just accept the idea that Shabriri is and has always been pure evil simply because he's supposed to be chaotic, or that he's always been the same person that he is when we meet him in-game even before he had his eyes gouged out.\n\nThe most common theory I've heard is that Shabriri slandered the wandering merchants, claiming that they worshipped the three fingers and flame of frenzy (this is the theory in Vaati's frenzy vid)\n\nbut 1. this couldn't be the case if the frenzy's presence in the Lands Between started with Shabriri. It's specifically stated that \"the sickness of the flame of frenzy began with Shabriri\" (Howl of Shabriri).\n\nand 2. the wandering merchants WERE imprisoned for this very crime, so if Shabriri's lie was proven to be false, then why were the merchants imprisoned anyway? Why would he be punished for slander if the golden order believed him and imprisoned the merchants, and if you wanna say that it was proven to be false after they had already been imprisoned then why weren't they released? it just doesn't make sense.\n\nIt's just never made sense to me that Shabriri told a damaging lie, was punished for it, and that was the event that caused the flame of frenzy, the outer god embodying the very concept of madness and chaos, to dwell within him. Why would the maddening flame of frenzy have originated from that of all things? If Shabriri had told a horrible lie and was punished for it, that's not maddening, that's just. Sure, the punishment probably doesn't fit the crime but still, he did something bad and was punished for it. It's always been my belief that the real reason it would have driven Shabriri to madness is because it wasn't a lie. For once he was telling the truth and nobody believed him. That's enough to drive anyone mad.\n\nI've always read it as a boy who cried wolf kind of scenario. Shabriri was a liar and reviled by all in his community for it, but one day he discovered some horrible truth about some well-respected figure, someone with power and influence, maybe in the world or just in his community. He tried to expose this person, but of course, Shabriri was already reviled by this point. He was known by all to be a liar and so, nobody believed him even though this time he really was telling the truth. As to who he accused, we can never really know, but it had to have been someone with a lot of influence for Shabriri's eyes to have been gouged out. If you're familiar with One Piece, you could compare his story to Usopp's story in Syrup Village. Every day Usopp would run through town claiming pirates were coming to raid the town, so the one day pirates did actually show up, and the one leading them was a respected figure of that town's community, nobody believed him.\n\nIdk if anyone else shares this line of thinking, I've only seen the more popular theories which all hinge on the fact that he was indeed telling a lie. i'd like to hear what other people think",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7ct4t",
    "score": 150,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "In a previous post I discussed in depth that in my opinion, the shattering done by Marika was an act of trying to figure out the future of the world and deal with the grief of Godwyn's death and the failure of the order. \n\nI explained how extending grace to the mending rune bearing tarnished, gideon and Godfrey are an attempt from Marika to explore the order through an external perspective as they all share multiple aspects of her and call back to multiple parts of her life. Fia as a reviled opressed life giver and mother, Goldmask as the seeker of knowledge and exploration of the depths of the order, The dung eater as a walking talking manifestation of the karmic dept, curses, trauma and hatred inflicted upon her by the hornsent and inflicted onto the hornsent in vengeance.\n\nThis post will focus on Goldmask, Metyr, Midra, Gideon and Radagon as a lot of people believe Goldmask's ending and mending rune to either be the best option or simply an eternal, unmodifiable return to the status quo, or believe everything he achieves in the game is nothing but nonsense ever since the reveals that the fingers that guided Marika were not communicating with the greater will but with the unhinged Metyr.\n\nMetyr and failure at motherhood : \n\nIf Hyetta and Ymir are to be believed, and I find no reason why they shouldn't in this case as they use different methods of communing with an outer god and study of the stars to reach the same conclusion, the world itself was born of the rapture of the one great, something Hyetta calls a mistake as it allowed for the creation of every life, every sin and every curse without hope for change. As in the elden ring world the two principles of the golden order observed through exploration of the depths of the ring are causality and regression. The principle of causality dictates every action has a reaction, meaning it is literally impossible to make an action not based on precedent reactions and for the future not to be affected by the actions of the present, this principle echoes the concept of original sin in Christianity and Karma in Buddhism. In that sense, the karmic dept of the world can become so severe that despair and frenzy become the only options. The greater will ruptures, abandons Metyr, who abandons her fingers, who abandon Marika, who abandons her children, who abandon the realm. The twin bird abandons the death birds. The dragon god abandons the ancient dragons. Rennala abandons Caria and her children... Existence in elden ring in this case is fundamentally incomplete and eternally looking at the mother for blame, curses and validation. No only that, but in their foolishness they yearn for motherhood in hope of being the mother they never had and giving birth to complete creatures. This is best told by the game through Ymir and Yuri and Ymir takes every tragedy and sin in the world and puts the blame wholly on the mother, bragging and hoping he is capable of replacing Metyr and birthing Yuri whole as a way to cope with the trauma of losing his child, but all he makes is more finger creepers, incomplete. His use of motherhood as a coping mechanism is also exemplified through his abuse of the sisters of night, as he wishes to be the only star, the only mother, the only beloved and the only source of love even if this involves locking away all evidence of one sister being turned into a puppet from the other and grooming them from childhood to be his swordhands raised in perpetual darkness that only he can illuminate.\n\nRadagon, is characterised by the game as constantly seeking completeness, meaning he is incomplete himself. His search for completeness  is shown in the game primarily through cultivation of knowledge and faith through his two unions and alchemically he serves as the symbolic king of the sun, the masculine half of the rebis. (This is medieval spiritual alchemy so we're about to get sexist but not really.) The king of the sun embodies masculinity as a spiritual concept inherently recognised, cultivated and curated by both the action and reactions of men and women. Defining what a man is, should be, shouldn't be, will do but shouldn't, won't do but should at all stages of life, this isn't one state of dos and don't for example a barbarian, a well manner gentleman and a sage are considered masculine in different ways and a woman embodiying these things does not stop them from being masculine... Order, gold, fire, sun, virile, lion, wise... Are all described in the great work as aspects of Masculinity that are to be integrated with the feminine to become complete. Yet, even during his age, Radagon is not the archetype of the masculine in the lands between, it's Godfrey. Ever since antiquity in the lands between it was Horah loux or Godfrey that defined the soul of what a man is, despite his banishment, the ruin of his lineage and his replacement by a much recent lord, the lands between ooses his influence and very print after centuries. The hornsent built their armor modeling naked form and wear lions as helms, the beast regent of farum azula is on his shoulders, the corpses of giants litter the mountaintops, the kaiden still roam limgrave upholding strength based fighting and subjugation of beasts through horse riding, the crucible knights he led still roam the lands, sword monuments stand to his defeated enemies, the colosseums still stand, the tarnished warriors of his are the last hope the lands between and even the fighting techniques he uses are used not only by badland warriors but also rank and file messmer soldiers, crucible knights and horned warriors. Even Radagon's own children have to look past his fundamentalism to grow and flourish as people, Rykard defies the order itself through the serpent embodying a perversion of Godfrey's will in the code of the recusants \"the strong take\", Radahn idolises Godfrey and his red hair (the part he hated about himself) and revived the traditions of martial might and colosseum lion fighting through the redmanes. Ranni follows the path shown by her mother and her mentor, Miquella gives up on fundamentalism as it failed his sister, Malenia finds guidance through the warrior that followed the old ways and taught her to mimic a bird dancing on water to fight the rot and when defeated echoes Godfrey's spirit in accepting defeat and admitting that your strength warrants the crown of a true lord, Melina explores the world and the order and concludes death is necessary and messmer locks himself in a room forever in grief if his abandonment by Marika without even paying him attention. Radagon spends his life gathering knowledge from Rennala and leaves her the instant he thinks he learned enough, even descrating the symbol of their union as a show of vanity. And when his order breaks he desperately tries to keep it together and locks himself and Marika away.\n\nThe spirit of Radagon lives thus through one man alone, Gideon Ofnir. A hunched over old man that spent his life gathering knowledge without wisdom, has no moral standing, lets others do his bidding and when he is faced with a dillema is immediately paralyzed in fear and gives up on his life goal, incapable of dealing with the state of aporia his revelations granted him. Not willing to intellectually wrestle and fight for his wanted position as elden lord and reaching a state of euporia. Nepheli, his adopted daughter's salvation even lies in abandoning him for a reaffirming of her identity as blood of Godfrey and seeking guidance from the stormhawk king as per the old ways and becoming lord of Limgrave as her ancestor did, her only other path is servitude as the puppet of a deviant. His counterpart in the DLC, sir Ansbach is ten thousand times more deserving of his monicker but his humility will never allow him to wear it, carries himself as a respected warrior honored and feared even by his enemies and accepts your lordship attained by defeating Mohg in an honorable duel as dictated by Godfrey.\n\nRadagon is thus ideologically obsolete and his seed is rotten, when viewed through this lens he is a failure at every level, never achieved completeness despite his godhood.\n\nGoldmask the complete : \n\nGoldmask represents intellectual completeness in elden ring through his form and existence, he communicates through movements of his fingers yet he is not seeking the guidance of a mother, brother Corhyn even affirms what he is doing is self reflection and calculus, symbolically meaning he is more complete than any two fingers. His DLC counterpart, sage Midra, is a dark reflection of him that after rigorous torture came to embrace the enlightenment of chaos given by the frame of frenzy, the opposite force to the golden order. While Midra carries that enlightenment as a ball of yellow fire on his shoulders, Goldmask carries it through his mask, symbol of his mastery over the secrets of Order itself. Their weakness is their physical feeblness, denying them the title of lord.\n\nGoldmask unlike what a lot of people think, stands in opposition to the golden order at it is. Going through rigorous questionning of the order, fighting through the aporia in order to reach the totality of the golden order. Goldmask is against the death hunters as he sees that a perfect order does not contain an evil for the good and the great to contend with, during his reflection on the order, when faced with the idea that Radagon is Marika he does not collapse or give up but simply keeps going, in the mountaintops he even commits to recognising the burning of the tree and the reintroduction of destined death into the golden order is absolutely necessary much to the confusion and fear of brother Corhyn. And it's not a coincidence that the rune he discovers is found on his corpse that still holds the pose of golden order totality, meaning an acceptance of death as part of the golden order. The rune was already there, he just found it through reflection and calculus, showing his level of deep wisdom surpassing Radagon and Gideon who give up the instant they are challenged by reality. \n\nAs the conclusion of Goldmask is that the golden order is possible and achieveable through removing the fickleness of the gods, the reintroduced destined death and the rejection of absolute evil and the affirmation of the game as his status of sage severing the dependance on a mother and finding completeness through embodying a finger that doesn't seek answers from outside. The golden order perfected by Goldmask is literally impossible to be the same thing as Radagon's as not only does it come from a more reflective perspective but it very clearly embraces aspects shunned by the order.\n\nNext is the dung eater, guilt, curses, cycles of violence and the karmic debt of Marika and the hornsent.\n\nOof this is long as hell.\n",

Both, the flower/tree and the statues depict surrounding trunks bearing flowers with a central trunk reaching up. In the case of the of the flower/tree, the central trunk is composed of two spiraling trunks while in the statue, a burned figure is helping a single trunk to be the central one, this trunk bearing a central golden flower. \n\nTheory time:\nAs some reliefs on Enir Illim and the Scadutree can indicate, the original form of the divine tree should have been a spiral. We know that this didn't come to pass, Marika ensured that light(gold) and darkess(shadow) remained separated in a physical and metaphysical way (even the lands of gold and the shadow realm are separated). But if the natural way is a spiral, how did Marika managed this? The burned statue holding the golden flower is the answer: the first burning of the Erdtree. As everyone knows, Leyndel is covered in ash, pointing to this happening in the past. But why? Well, why do we burn the Erdtree? To usher a new age. All the game endings need the Erdtree to be burnt for us to usher a new age, with the Erdtree changing in the process. That's why the burned figure is depicted helping the golden flower rise amongst the crucible, this statue is depicting the kindling maiden that ended the age of the crucible and enabled the age of the Erdtree. And yes, I think that the statue is depicting Melina before she was burned and bodiless. The godhunt could have been a way to purge Marika's lineage from her less than desirable descendants and Melina could have been playing her role, just as her older brother, Messmer. Messmer burned the hornsent following her mothers orders but other descriptions say that he escaped from the capital. Messmer was used as a cover up for Marikas true intentions and I think that Melina suffered the same fate. The tree had to be burned and  some demigods had to die but Marika couldn't be related to this so, as Messmer did, Melina was asked to take the fall.  ",

She wielded the power of flame (like her brother messmer) and infused it with the power of destined death to create her weapon she could use to defeat her mother. The Godslaying Black Flame. (This also tracks with how each of the Demigods claimed a great rune from the Elden Ring. The \u201cGreat Rune\u201d of the Gloam Eyed Queen was the Rune of Death) \n\nUltimately Melina met her end as the Gloam Eyed Queen when she was defeated by Maliketh of the Black Blade, Marikas shadow. (This also would give further cause for why the Demigods all feared Maliketh) \n\nHowever, even though Maliketh killed her she did not die, because upon her defeat her mother Queen Marika removed the rune of death from the Elden Ring. And Maliketh then sealed the rune inside his blade. Thus her body died but yet she lives burned and bodiless. ( My own theory is that at this time she remained dormant in the form of a rememberance)\n\nFast forward to the shattering. Marika is now held captive inside the Erdtree by the Greater Will as punishment for shattering the Elden Ring.\n\nMarika knows that only \u201cones who envision Flame\u201d have the power to burn the erdtree and thus gain access to where she is. (As confirmed by Finger Reader Enia)\n\nFrom inside the Erdtree she uses the remembrance of the Gloam Eyed Queen her daughter, to resurrect her as Melina. And tasks her with the role of serving as the Kindling Maiden and aiding the tarnished who would be Lord. \n\n(I think it also might be possible to say she is a special type of spirit ash summon that Marika created from the Gloam Eyed Queen remains)\n\nFast forward to Frenzied Flame ending. Now that the Rune of death has been unsealed by the Tarnished. Her power she wielded as the Gloam Eyed Queen has now also been unsealed as well. \nAnd we see her transformed.\n\nThe reason Melina eye was always closed before was because it held a remnant of the power of destined death. The mark over her eye I believe represented a shard of the Rune of Death. \n\nNow the rune of death is unleashed and the power of Destined death that was sealed in her eye (or perhaps the ability to control Destined Death) has been unleashed with it.\n\nThus the Gloam Eyed Queen is reborn. \n\n\n\n",

Given the fire relationship, this name follows the E-naming scheme for the serpents: Eiglay and Eveligne (Rykard\u2019s God Devouring Serpent). The name Elleh being the name of the first church we found is more than just a coincidence or a mere triviality. In truth, this explains the supposed sins of all the crucified people around that church. They are the faithful of the Gloam-Eyed Queen Elleh.",

    "title": "With Regards to Height in Elden Ring",
    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p29oyl",
    "score": 108,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "So we know all the demigods and gods and Elden Ring experience a boost in height due to divinity. The demigods tower over most beings in the game. Even demigods such as Ranni are speculated to be eight feet tall when they had there empyrean flesh  and Miquella received growth burst when he uses the gate of divinity overcoming his curse of youth.\n\nOne can conclude that Divine Blood plays a role in ones height. The more one has divine blood in them the taller they can be.\n\nBut then there are outliers; Rennala, Rellana, Loretta, O'Neil, Godfrey, Loretta and Niall. Both exhibit heights that rival the demigods and gods. This includes Rennala herself being two feet taller then Marika and Radagon.\n\nSo divine blood clearly has its limits, that mortals can surpass. Now all the outliers have one two things in common; their all warriors/champions who fought in wars and their all old by real life standards.\n\nNow, it should be noted that there are other ancient figures that do not experience a height growth specifically the Carian Knights who are as old as Lorretta and remain Tarnish size.\n\nClearly age by itself does not effect the height but what about the other binding factor to the outliers; combat.\n\nWe only need to look to our own Tarnish who is capable of slaying many great champions and growing stronger but still witness no growth spurt.\n\nSo combat by itself is clearly not a factor for height in the Lands Between...\n\nBut What if  the factors of time and combat worked in tangent to contribute to height?\n\nI hypothesize a formula for height\n\n***Divine Blood + ( Time x Runes Gathered)= Height***\n\nLets plug this formula into certain characters to see if it matches out.\n\nThe greatest example of this is Radahn who in his star scourge form is one of the tallest humanoids in the Land Between.\n\nRadahn has the divine blood of Radagon/ Marika and he participated in allot of fights in the shattering which takes place over many years. All these factors would contribute to greater height for Radahn based on my proposed formula.\n\nNow lets take a look at our Tarnish and plug them into this formula. They have no divine blood so that factor would be zero. The Tarnishes journey from start to finish is pretty short compared to the history of the demigods and champions of the Lands Between  so the age factor would be a near zero as well. This leaves the runes gathered which is the only positive factor for the Tarnish but the effects of that requires more time to contribute to height.\n\nNow lets look at a demigod that that barely fights in the history of the Lands Between; Ranni before she became a doll.  It is speculated that Ranni's original height is around eight to nine feet tall. Now she does have some fights under her belt as seen with her besting Adula, but in order for it to count to the rune factor she has to kill and take the runes of those she defeat. So Ranni rune factor is near zero so no matter how old she gets she wont grow that much. Ranni does show the limits of  how much divine blood can impact height by itself. With one parent of divinity the height is eight to nine feet tall.\n\n\n\nNow lets look at a trickery example the Carian Knights. We only fight two in game one protecting Rennala and one protecting Rellana. Neither of them have divine blood so that factor would be zero. Their both pretty old so that factor would be high but despite being very good at combat they are only Tarnish size. Now remember what I said about Rannis combat factor being low because she didn't kill anyone directly. The Carian Knights were renown for their skills in combat but said skills might have been acquired through friendly spares with each other improving their blade work. Since no deaths occurred their rune factor would remain  near zero. When looking at the what the two Carian Knights are doing in game this makes perfect sense; their both body guards protecting the Carian Sisters, not warriors leading the charge against the enemies of Caria.\n\nCompare that to another Carian Knight who most likely played a more active role; Loretta. She has zero divine blood but probably participated in both Liurnian Wars allowing her to gain quite a bit of runes over time contributing to her height.\n\nSpeaking of Liurnian Wars we have Rennala, who participated in two wars against the Erd Tree.  She has no divine blood so that factor would be zero for her, but seeing how she was the champion of Liurnia and fought in two wars her rune count would be pretty high, enough to catch the eyes of Radagon.\n\nAnd one final example; Malenia. Her divine blood grants her a default height of eight feet tall but she is short despite being warrior. I believe similar to the Carian Knights, Malenia combat experience was built up over the years through friendly spares and training under her mentor that taught her to resist the scarlet rot.  Malenia is a empyrean too precious to lose in a war so she would most likely be forbidden from fighting against hostile forces while Marika was still active. Not to mention she was the protector of Miquella and acted as a body guard for him similar to that of the two Carian Knights in game who protect their lieges. Finally we have the cinematic where Radahn fights Malenia in which Malenia is forced to reattach her prosthetic arm mid fight something which foes less honorable then Radahn would take advantage of and use the opportunity to kill the child of Marika. I think these factors indicate that Malenia despite being one of the most skilled combatants in the Lands between has a low rune factor contributing to her height being way less then that of Radahn. So for Malenia she would only have divine blood working towards her height.\n\nIn conclusion I believe that height in Elden Ring is determine by the amount of divine blood in a individual and a  factor of runes that kicks in over time.",

    "body": "Maybe this is explained or discussed before but I don't exactly understand how Miqula is a god.\n\n From what I understand when Marika became a goddess she received the Elden Beast, so isn't a god someone that is the vessel for a higher being like the Elden Beast, or maybe Metyr, or that thing with a big eye inside the fire giant, also the only other god that I remember would be Malinia who became a goddess. Still, I am not sure if she was hosting anything i assume that she was hosting something that was causing the rot inside her and kept blooming when she got close to death or something.\n\nSo, how about Miqula? Is he hosting something, or has he become like a higher being, like the Elden Beast? And there are 2 cases here but I don't understand them both:\n\n1- The game says he followed Marika's footsteps but does that mean that Marika also abandoned her body cause it doesn't seem like it. And if so then Miquella became a vessel same as she did. But where is it that he is hosting we don't see like even a trace of it?\n\n2- Miquella didn't do same as Marika (becoming a vessel), instead he ascended and is now like a higher being that has his own will, and I assume in this case we consider Radahn to be the god similar to Marika, not like the elden lord as Godfrey was to her but then again the game says that we slayed a god and a lord so i make no sense mostly.\n",

Both bosses have similar lore, since they are both born from the accumulation of a mass of dead organisms.\n\nIn the Scholar\u2019s quest we discover that he is an albinauric and that he wants to find the purifying tear to cure his illness, which he ultimately fails to do. But his mission is not useless, since with the purifying tear he manages to purify the Dreg Lord.\nAfter purifying the Dreg Lord, he gets from it the same circlet that the old albinaurics wear. This connects the Dreg lord with the albinaurics. \n\n Finally, to connect the Scholar with Elden John, his dawn skin is very similar to Elden John\u2019s, who I believe was the God of another era, and on his hat we see a depiction of the Elden Ring. Even the solver tears and the Putrescence masses are very similar.\n\nThe Cerulian Coast is full of stone coffins, but unlike the fissure, these don\u2019t have a drop of putrescence coming out of them. This is probably because they transformed into humanoid beings. It\u2019s possible that this happened when the putrescence came into contact with some of the larval tears that appear naturally in TLOS.\n\nThe theory: Elden John\u2019s people are the first artificial race to appear in the Lands Between.\n\n\n",

    "body": "# Overview\n\nHere's what we know of the Carian Knights in general:\n\n* The Carian Knights (also referred to as \"Enchanted Knights\") were anointed by the Lunar Queen\n* They were all heroes of the highest honors, but fell into disarray with the decline of the royal family\n* They served as direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses\n* They were awarded the Carian Filigreed Crest, which is described as an \"honor\", reducing the burden of casting sorceries\n* They were gifted the Carian Glintblade Staff, rather than the Carian Glintstone Staff (which would enable Sorcerers to take on the role of an enchanted knight, likely in lieu of being able to wield both sorceries and swords)\n* They had sorceries bestowed upon them by the Carian Royal family. \"Human\" Carian Knights, for example, combined the Glintblade Phalanx with their swordsmanship to maintain pressure upon their foes, striking in waves of steel and sorcery.\n* Enchanted troll knights were \"the comrades of the young Rennala, bound by oath.\"\n* The Carian Knights are said to \"never waver\", with the \"Human\" Carian Knights leveraging the Lucidity sorcery to alleviate any onset of Sleep and Madness\n* The \"Human\" Carian Knights carried a shield said to excel when facing both magic or holy attacks, which points to enemies from both Liurnia (anticipating betrayal from the Academy, referenced in the \"Carian Retaliation\" sorcery) and Leyndell (Erdtree Sentinels, rather than Dragon Cultists, perhaps?)\n* These knights' swords could serve as catalysts, letting them wield sorcerous battle skills\n* They formerly used the Carian Sorcery Sword (said to be used by \"the Carian knights of old\") before the full refinement of their sorcerous combat techniques, as it functioned as a catalyst for glintstone sorcery when executing strong attacks. Note that the Weapon Skill for this sword is \"Impaling Thrust\", same as the \"Spear\" that was once used by the Enchanted Knight class in V1.00, though back then, that was known as the \"Winged Spear\" and used \"Charge Forth\" as the base weapon skill.\n* Despite numbering fewer than twenty, this power to wield sorcerous battle skills made them a match for even the champions of gold in battle\n* **Adding this point regarding Troll Knights because I forgot to when I first posted:** *Called into service when the Queen invoked an oath they swore,* *the trolls are treated as true knights of Caria, and fight arm in arm with their human comrades.*\n\nWhile we obviously can never really say whether it was a rule to only have fewer than twenty Carian Knights at any given time, as a broad statement, it begs the question: **how many can we realistically account for?**\n\n# \"Human\" Carian Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #1: Loretta**\n\n* **Quote:** \"Loretta was once a royal Carian Knight and her lapis-lazuli blue cape is the emblem of the knightly pride that continues to guide her\"\n* **Quote:** Undertook a \"long, bloody journey to seek out a place where the Albinaurics could live in peace\" and \"determined that the Haligtree was their best chance for eventual salvation.\"\n* **Quote:** \"It is said that the bow was Loretta's favored weapon.\"\n* **Quote:** Her war sickle is said to have originally \"been given for service as a personal guard to Carian royalty\"\n* **Observation:** She is now a Knight of the Haligtree, loyal to Miquella, with her war sickle's blue glintstone now replaced by unalloyed gold\n* **Observation:** Rumored to be an Albinauric, though the game's text decries this rumor as \"absurd\"\n\n**Carian Knight #2: Moongrum**\n\n* **Observation:** Guards the entrance of the elevator leading up to Rennala at the Raya Lucarian Academy\n* **Observation:** Wields a Carian Knight's Shield (with Carian Retaliation), a Carian Knight's Sword, uses an Academy Glintstone Staff to cast Carian Piercer.\n* **Observation:** The Carian Piercer is a counterpart to the Carian Greatsword sorcery, which itself is said to allow sorcerers to \"gain the strength of knights, their loyalty sworn to the moon.\"\n* **Theory:** While some theorize that Moongrum turned on Rellana and sided with the Academy, the Academy itself seems to be splintered and lacks leadership. My personal belief is that Moongrum is still loyal to Rennala and is found where he is because he's protecting her. His mostly Carian loadout is only contradicted by his choice of staff, which itself is still using a Carian sorcery; it's not a massive leap to guess that he entered the ranks of the Carian Knights when the Carian Royals and the Raya Lucarian Academy were allied.\n\n**Carian Knight #3: Moonrithyll**\n\n* **Observation:** Found at Castle Ensis, guarding the path ultimately leading to Rellana, Twin Moon Knight, Rellana's younger sister, and former Carian Princess\n* **Observation:** Described as \"steadfast\", Moonrithyll was the \"Twin Moon Knight's chamberlain\"\n* **Quote:** \"She was also a friend to the trolls, who served the royal family, and proudly wielded their weapons as she fought arm in arm with her gargantuan comrades\"\n* **Observation:** Rellana's Cameo, found at the altar directly behind where Moonrithyll is fought, speaks of an \"unparalleled devotion of those who left their homelands to serve Rellana.\"\n* **Quote:** The following quote, included in the description of the Cameo, may be attributed to her, given its proximity to where she was found: *'By your leave, we will accompany you wherever your lunar vessel takes you.'*\n* **Theory:** Physically, she appears to be a genderbent version of Moongrum; their common name structure and respective protection of siblings of Carian royalty (former or otherwise) reinforces the notion that, even if they aren't twins, they may at the very least be siblings or related in some way\n\n**Carian Knight #4: Carian Manor Spirit**\n\n* **Observation:** As the name suggests, this Carian Knight is found at Caria Manor, though they are already deceased\n* **Observation:** When spoken to, their dialogue indicates that their loyalty is specifically to Ranni: \"Lady Ranni, we have long awaited you. I pray for your house's swift arrival. May the full moon shine upon Caria.\"\n* **Observation:** While I cannot directly confirm this myself, this [face guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3275057381) suggests that Moongrum's model is reused here; there's no canon reason to believe this is Moongrum's twin brother, but I won't stop you from speculating\n* **Observation:** It is important to me, for the sake of Carian Knight #17, that this reinforces that Carian Knights were \"direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses\", of which Ranni once was (**EDIT:** This is poorly phrased -- what I'm getting at here is that this Carian Knight seems to not just be a direct retainer to the Carian princesses in general, but possibly specifically to Ranni)\n\n# Carian Troll Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #5: Bols**\n\n* **Observation:** Locked inside the Cuckoo's Evergaol, clearly implying that it was the Knights of the Cuckoo who imprisoned him there, and that he defended Caria when the Academy split from Caria in the aftermath of Radagon's departure\n* **Observation:** Wields the Troll Knight's Sword, specifically with the ability to cast Greatblade Phalanx\n* **Observation:** Drops Greatblade Phalanx when killed, which is said to be used by the enchanted troll knights\n\n**Carian Knight #6: Troll Knight in Caria Manor**\n\n* **Observation:** Effectively the same moveset as Bols (**EDIT:** Just assume this is true for all Troll Knights)\n* **Theory:** By virtue of where this Troll Knight is found, this Troll Knight is still loyal to the Carian Royalty, and is one of the few Troll Knights that are still living\n\n**Carian Knight #7: Troll Knight outside Converted Fringe Tower**\n\n* **Theory:** One can assume, given the role of Carian Knight #6, that this Troll Knight was loyal to the sorcerer controlling the Converted Fringe Tower. It is unlikely this sorcerer was a Carian princess, so it leaves a question as to why the enchanted troll knight here, still clad in Carian armor and wielding Carian weaponry, pledged their loyalty to a sorcerer. However, this would not be the only example of this kind of questionable allegiance, especially because we know that they fell into disarray with the decline of the royal family.\n* **Observation:** This tower in East Liurnia contains Haima sorceries and requires those who enter to be in possession of a Glinstone crown, to know the Erudition gesture, and to perform it in front of the statue of Marika; there is another Converted Tower in West Liurnia with a similar requirement.\n* **Theory:** As this is not a Sorcerer's Rise, and a statue of Marika is found in it, and one must display their \"Erudition\" (or in other terms, their \"Intelligence\") in front of the literal embodiment of \"Faith\", maybe there's something suggesting that these towers were \"converted\" from outposts that once belonged to Erdtree forces to Carian/Academy Towers.\n* **Theory:** Whoever controlled this tower, if it was not Haima themselves (as they were the adjudicator of the Academy), belonged to Haima's conspectus. Given that a Graven School is found here, this particular sorcerer may have some strong ties to the Primeval Current, or at the very least Sellen and Azur. There is definitely some lore worth reconciling.\n\n**Carian Knight #8: Troll Knight in Castle Ensis**\n\n* **Observation:** A similar parallel between Moongrum and Moonrithyll, this Troll Knight parallels the Troll Knight found defending Caria Manor\n* **Theory:** This Troll Knight may explicitly have been friends with Moonrithyll, given her camaraderie with the Troll Knights\n* **Theory:** We can assume a similar characterization with Rellana, i.e. they would have also demonstrated the \"unparalleled devotion of those who left their homelands to serve Rellana.\"\n\n**Carian Knight #9: Blue Spectral Troll Knight in Liurnia Highway North**\n\n* **Observation:** Seemingly protects the road leading to the Academy from Raya Lucarian soldiers. May serve the Twinsage sorcerer at the Highway Lookout Tower, who summons a small squadron of Aristocrats and Wandering Noble Sorcerers in front of the tower.\n* **Theory:** It is worth noting that the Twinsage sorcerer's presence may not be dissimilar to how the Converted Towers were taken over, though in this particular instance, the Twinsage sorcerer took this tower from the Raya Lucarian soldiers...which, seems odd if you consider that they're both supposed to be aligned with the Academy against Caria. The game does allude to the Cuckoo Knights' \"refusal to be mere servants of the academy\", so perhaps these are the embers of a war between Raya Lucaria and the Cuckoos? If so, it is curious to see a Carian Knight on the side of the Academy against the Cuckoos.\n* **Question:** Sort of a general question I have for people who may understand the concept better than I do: I often see these blue spirits referred to as \"puppets\", but can't find an example of where this is explicitly referenced. Do we know for sure that these are puppets?\n* **Theory:** If the above is true, than this Carian Knight, as well as all the Wandering Noble spirits, is clearly under the control of the Twinsage sorcerer, possibly unwillingly\n* **Observation:** In contradiction to the above, there are two cases that I feel contradict the notion of a 'puppet'. The Rennala projection can an oath-sworn Troll, suggesting that the 'oath' may extend beyond life itself, and can be invoked in a manner similar to spirit ashes, though these spirits are not blue. Fia, on the other hand, summons her champions (through what mechanism, I'm not sure), and they definitely *are* blue, which calls into question whether or not they are puppets, or are similarly oath-sworn.\n\n# Headless Spectral Troll Knights\n\n**Carian Knights #10, #11, #12: Headless Spectral Troll Knights guarding the Four Belfries**\n\n* **Observation:** There are three headless knights here, though only one \"spawns\" in the way that Carian Knight #9 does. The other two are seemingly always there.\n* **Observation:** Curiously, even though this area is known as the \"Four Belfries\" there are only three waygates.\n* **Theory:** There is a connection, though unclear, between these Headless Troll Knights and the Mausoleum Soldiers/Knights guarding the Walking Mausoleums and the Black Knife Catacombs. We know that Mausoleum Knights invoked a \"self-inflicted curse that ties the spirits of these loyal knights to the land, having willingly beheaded themselves so that they may serve their masters in death.\"\n* **Theory:** There is no evidence for this, but one potential theory is that each waygate corresponds to one of the Headless Troll Knights. Perhaps it was the sacrifice of each of these knights that closed off the waygates, and it is through an oath or self-inflicted curse that they continue to protect these waygates as spectral beings. It remains unclear what the Four Belfries have to do with Caria, but their being in Liurnia naturally creates strong ties to begin with. Likewise, hard to know whether these waygates are being protected in the name of Caria.\n* **Question:** Maybe people have elaborated on this in other posts, but the relief of a bearded man in front of the branches fo the Erdtree strikes me as similar to the reliefs of the Haligtree found in throughout the Haligtree itself, e.g. on the tombstones found in the graveyard near the Haligtree Roots. Is this a connection or similarity that I'm imagining?\n\n**Carian Knight #13: Headless Spectral Troll Knight guarding Fifth Belfry outside Castle Ensis**\n\n* Pretty much everything stated about Carian Knights #10, #11, and #12 applies to this Carian Knight. Its proximity to Castle Ensis strongly reinforces the connection between the Four Belfries and Caria.\n\n# Unconfirmed, but likely Carian Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #14: The Great Coffin west of Liurnia of the Lakes**\n\n* **Observation:** This Great Coffin stops at the edge of the lake, directly across from Testu's Rise, and contains a Carian Knight's Sword. It is escorted by a large group of Cuckoo soldiers. The path taken by the Great Coffin is also patrolled by a Cuckoo Knight pacing back and forth repeatedly.\n* **Observation:** Though it is now cut content, we know from a note on Great Coffins that they \"travel the Lands Between, carrying the bodies of nameless fallen warriors.\" It is therefore more than reasonable to assume that this Great Coffin is carrying the body of a fallen Carian Knight, though one seemingly respected by the Cuckoos.\n* **Theory:** Stopping at the edge of the western lakeshore may indicate that this Carian Knight has some sort of connection, either a fondness or a desire to be laid to rest here, or maybe it has more to do with the preferences of the Cuckoos escorting the Great Coffin. It's not terribly clear. However, the fact that it is across from Testu's Rise is interesting, as it again paints a picture of a Carian Knight who, possibly, was loyal to a sorcerer. Moreover, Testu may or may not have had abilities related to necromancy, as the puzzle that needs to be solved in order to enter the Rise raises putrid corpses from the ground.\n\n**Carian Knight #15: The Tombstone in Raya Lucaria graveyard**\n\n* **Observation:** Three Putrid Corpses (either possessed by way of sorcery or by glintstone itself) are seemingly worshipping this tombstone, upon which lays the armor of a Carian Knight.\n* **Theory:** One can infer that the tombstone, and therefore the grave it sits atop, once belonged to a Carian Knight, one who possibly lived and died at a time when Caria and the Academy were still aligned. It is unclear why the Putrid Corpses are drawn to this grave, but one can infer that, even in a state of seeming undeath, they retain enough sense to revere this Carian Knight that they may have known, recognized, or even revered in life.\n\n# Unconfirmed, may or may not have been Carian Knights\n\n# \n\n**Carian Knight #16: Corpse in Highway Lookout Tower**\n\n* **Observation:** This corpse is found directly behind the Twinsage sorcerer at the top of the Highway Lookout Tower, though it may be unlikely that the Twinsage sorcerer killed this individual, as the corpse is smoldering. It is in fact identical to the corpse found in the lower levels of the Roundtable Hold, except that it is holding a rusted rapier, possibly suggesting that it was present at the battle that had occurred at Liurnia Highway North involving the Marionettes and the Flame Chariots.\n* **Observation:** Quite critically, the Carian Glintblade Staff is found on this corpse, which we know were gifted to Enchanted Knights. It is unlikely that this staff would be found in the hands of anyone other than a Carian Knight for this express reason.\n* **Observation:** There is precedent for items relating to a specific character being found on a smoldering corpse implied to have been said character: Lionel's armor can be found on a corpse sitting on a bed directly next to where the Deathbed Dress is found. Lionel is already one of Fia's champions, and declared himself to be her father in life when they met, so it's fairly clear that this smoldering corpse was Lionel.\n* **Theory:** Regarding that battle, I think it may have been separate to the battle that is presently occurring between the Cuckoos and the Twinsage sorcerer's blue spectres. Everything being rusted is one indication, but the other is all the Exile Soldier and Banished Knight weaponry found marking the battlefield; this weaponry is also found inside the tower. Stormveil is within riding distance of this area, so it's possible that this was a battle between Stormveil forces and the Academy.\n* **Theory:** Alternatively, given that the Spirit NPC states that the puppets were besieging \"us\", from the perspective of a Wandering Noble Sorcerer spirit, maybe this was where the Academy first betrayed Caria.\n\n**Carian Knight #17: The Ash of War dropped by the Night's Cavalry in Liurnia**\n\n* **Theory:** By far the weakest and maybe the most unnecessary case for a Carian Knight, but I didn't want to ignore it. I had previously made a post suggesting that the Ashes of War dropped by the Night's Cavalry were once the Weapon Skills of warriors that they had defeated. This Ice Spear is said to be a \"skill of the warriors who served Lunar Princess Ranni.\" It does not explicitly state that this is a Carian Knight, but we do know Carian Knight #4 had clear ties to Ranni. Enchanted Knights, when they were a starting class, once wielded the \"Winged Spear\", which eventually became just the \"Spear\" in the final game. In both the CNT and the final game, this weapon \"can be wielded from behind the safety of a raised shield\", which may reference the Carian Knight's Shield, and is also said to be \"very effective against mounted foes\", which suggests that Carian Knights would have encountered mounted foes in Liurnia. While it's likely this could have been referencing Erdtree Sentinels and later Cuckoo Knights, this Enchanted Knight may have come across and been felled by a Night's Cavalry. Moreover, we know that the Spear is infusable; if we look to Blaidd as a reference to what happens when an oath is sworn, his \"sword was imbued with a cold magic at the moment oath was sworn\", which could have occurred if this Enchanted Knight swore an oath to Ranni, granting them the Ice Spear as a Weapon Skill.",

Nothing concrete, really just Headcanon. \n\nFair Warning, this will be long. Why? Because there are potential tangential connections between some things spoken here with other elements of the game\u2019s world. Does any of this matter? No, but it\u2019s fun, if very runny (it\u2019s actually quite messy but I\u2019ll release it as it is; Forsaken Hollows won\u2019t load for me and I\u2019m getting impatient). \n\nThere will also be comments {below} relating to older games. They can be skipped. They are there to connect ideas between games and display common themes. \n\n//////////////////////////////////////\n\nSnake-Snails (Snailkes)\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nWhy do they exist? I think what\u2019s squarely to blame is the Crucible. The Crucible is responsible for animal-like traits being transferred onto humans via mutation, but it\u2019s also tied to creatures such as the Hippopotami, chimeric beasts found in the Realm of Shadow (and who fight alongside Crucible Knights in Nightreign), meaning it also meshes and melds the features of various animals onto other animals. \n\nThere are five Snake-Snail variants (one unused). The standard Snake-Snails appear in Volcano Manor, appropriately, as well as in other disparate location such as Nokstella and Rauh. They drop Serpent Arrows, attributed to a group known as the Formless Serpents. They slither, bite, and spit poison. Not much to note, but the Rauh location feels like it points towards my Crucible Hypothesis rather cleanly. \n\nThe Volcano Manor hosts the God-Devouring Serpent so there\u2019s a correlation with their appearance there. \n\nIt should be noted that you can connect Snakes with the element of fire in this game via their symbology, finding their way amongst the Godskins, Rykard, and Messmer; one of Messmer\u2019s symbols is a caduceus (a classical symbol involving two snakes), a sort of spiral, thus perhaps associating the snake with the Crucible and its spiral symbol; a connection possible to make due to minor details like how flame spirals in various magical forms, such as Furnace Golems which have Fire Giant Masks, giants being blessed by the Crucible according to the Talisman-of-all-Crucibles, and Embers of Messmer\u2019s being used to craft Fire Spritestones out of Rauh Burrows. The physiology of Godskin Nobles are also compared to the melding of the Crucible via their robes, and they bear reptilian tails. \n\nSnakes are also associated with poison, obviously; it should also be noted that Marais Manor, east and downstream of Gelmir, apparently once hosted the wielders of the Serpent Arrows (according to early versions - 1.00 apparently; my only source is a spreadsheet put together by Garden of Eyes); the House and its members are sick and associated with poison. \n\nNokstella is a harder locale to connect, especially since I know most people haven\u2019t even noticed the Snake-Snails there. They are found in a small section of the lower city, to the right of the river going downstream from the Nokstella Grace. There are no real connections here, besides tangential connections of a distant nature which don\u2019t explain much of anything. \n\n1. Ranni was involved with the Eternal Cities, getting its assassins to her side. Her brother is connected to her conspiracy to assassinate Godwyn, but that doesn\u2019t really explain the Snake-Snails\u2019 appearance here. \n2. (Warning: Unhinged Archaeology [\ud83e\udd2e] Speculation) The Eternal Cities have no connection to the Crucible, but the Night may. Dewgems are lotus flowers found in the Realm of Shadow which are fed on Night-tinged dew. They are found by water here, notably appearing in Rauh. Another night related thing in this realm are Larval Tears which are conjured at Spirit Graves at Night. They are functionally the same as the Silver Larvae in the base game. There isn\u2019t much here; they aren\u2019t really anything besides natural vermin (I was going to go off on a tangent about the giant stone coffins which are depicted on stelae in the Ancient Dynastical territories; some SOTE concept art depicts one atop Rauh; basically I was going to say that the Rauh people became the Ancient Dynasties and Nox, but that\u2019s too conspiratorial for talking about why snake-snails are in Nokstella; especially since it doesn\u2019t even explain anything besides why they\u2019re in both locations). \n3. The Silver Tears of the Nox are based on Alchemical beliefs regarding quicksilver, a fluctuating semi-fluid substance. An important symbol of Alchemy is the snake (in other esoteric systems it can take the form of the Ouroburos), sometimes depicted as a three headed dragon representing salt (body), quicksilver (mind), and sulfur (soul). The caduceus is a related symbol consisting of snakes forming a spiral. A word that can be used to conceptually tie these things together is the word \u201cformless\u201d; it\u2019s used to describe multiple things relating to the Arcane stat, such as the Formless Mother, the \u201cFormless\u201d Dragon Communion Seal (according to the seal\u2019s description), and the Formless Serpents and \u201cFormless\u201d Silver Tears (according to the Silver Tear Mask description). \n\nThe Cobra-Snails got cut from the game so there\u2019s nothing to talk about regarding them. \n\nInstead we could talk about the arrows and their accompanying bow. I mentioned earlier that an early version of the game stated that the Formless Serpents were once minions of Marais; the bow is found in the Abandoned Cave, full of trashed Abductor Virgins. It would stand to reason these Formless Serpents were possibly minions of Rykard, the cave dump being a Volcano Manor storage site in Caelid due to an alliance between the Carian brothers\u2019. Radahn may\u2019ve had use for them, who knows. The bow is powered by pagan magic; Arcane; the God-Devouring Serpent potentially being considered a pagan God (alluded to by the Serpent-God\u2019s Curved Sword). The arrows have a caduceus in place of fletching. \n\nMakes me wonder\u2026 perhaps the Formless Serpents used Invisibility Sorcery to get their moniker, potentially because the dump is near Sellia and some Serpent-Snails are found in Nokstella?\n\nI bring that up because the Serpent-Snails drop the arrows for some reason. That always felt weird to me. They don\u2019t have pockets. Do we make them from them? Is this the only way (other than corpses) the devs could think of to get us these arrows? It feels like a Dark Souls 2 situation to me where we needed a certain animal enemy to drop a certain human item (I\u2019m specifically referencing the kobolds that drop Black Knight weapons). \n\nOther than them there is the crystal Snake-Snail, one you might encounter earlier as they appear in the Lakeside Crystal Cave. They appear in multiple locations where crystals are present, such as the Altus Tunnel, the broader Liurnian area, the Consecrated Snowfield (ice is crystal and treated as a type of Glintstone, appearing as buds here like the Crystal Bud), Sellia Crystal Tunnel, and the Moonlight Altar. \n\nGlintstone parasitizes life, as demonstrated by the Glintstone Fireflies they can drop. They can still spit poison and have additional powers such as spitting Glintstone as projectiles or trails. The areas they inhabit have the same overarching crystalline visuals so their crystalline properties are explainable, but why snake-snails in these locations? Besides crystal, (some of) these locations have Carian associations (which could involve Rykard) such as the Altus and Sellia Tunnels which have Crystallians at their ends. The Moonlight Altar is Carian property and those in base Liurnia are around the crystalline zones below the altar. The Snowfield holds the Rotten Duelists who are decorated with snakes; the snakes come \u201calive\u201d during grab attacks\u2026 but the Duelists have no apparent lore other than serving in ritual combat during Godfrey\u2019s reign, the snake being a despised symbol. Why are they rotten? Did they fight alongside Radahn/Malenia? Is it rotten blood? Did they enter Malenia\u2019s rotten gash? Besides them, Ordina is nearby, has Black Knife Assassins in its gaol, and Loretta serves the Haligtree, so\u2026 \n\nHonestly, there\u2019s no straightforward reason these little guys are so widespread, and aren\u2019t so widespread. Symbolic associations are nearby, but not every Crystallian cave is accompanied by Snake-Snails. Their presence is arbitrary. \n\nSkeletal Snake-Snails are\u2026 still snaily. They still fold into their shells and their skeleton\u2019s length is the same as the others. Their\u201dshells\u201d are large humanoid skulls. They are found in the Death Bird section of the graveyard within Leyndell\u2019s outer layer of walls, the Sage\u2019s Grotto (With Garris; Black Knife Assassin nearby), and the mass graveyard atop the Mountaintops (with the Mariner). \n\nThey are among Those Who Live in Death. They can breathe out Ghostflame Wraiths and nothing else. They can roll like the others, touching mouth to tail, which is interesting. It may not be intentional but this would replicate the shape of an Ouroboros. The Ouroburos is a symbol of a snake eating its own tail, symbolizing the cycle of life and death; rebirth. Since they live within death I would say this is fitting. \n\nThe graveyards they appear in are supposedly for the Golden Order as one is found in Leyndell\u2019s walls and the other is in the Mountaintops where the Golden Order fought the Giants. The latter does contain giant spirits, possibly traitors of the Fire Giants, like the trolls; if not it may be a grave for those before (astrologers and giants). Both have a local Deathbird so it\u2019s possible that both yards predate Order. Snakes would fit then, but why didn\u2019t the Order excise these elements? \n\nGarris\u2019s cave is an undead sanctuary, the snakes acting as Garris\u2019s familiars (the sheltering of the assassin here also makes sense). The cave is downstream of Mount Gelmir. \n\nSnakes are related to spirituality as seen by Rykard and Eingley, their body containing many spirits, even summoning them via the mouth and the dispersed heat from unsettling the corpses that make up the cavern floor (if you hadn\u2019t noticed, the mist that summons the fire wraiths during his fight is amassed from his swings hitting the ground). \n\nThe last Snake-Snail is the Spiritcaller Snail. They lack snail eyes and they shake their heads and tails to emit a ringing like a Spiritcaller Bell to summon forth spirits. One is in the Road\u2019s End Catacombs summoning a Crucible Knight to its defense. One lingers in the top floor of the Leyndell Catacombs where it summons Leyndell soldiers to its defense. A few are posted up in the Haligtree Village to summon Crystallians. A bunch of them linger in the Spiritcaller\u2019s Cave, summoning wolves, disciples of Okina, and Godskins. \n\nIt would seem to me that these guys are actually deployed, not just nesting. They may have an affinity with spirits but they defend positions strategically such as, what would\u2019ve been, the entrance to the Leyndell Catacombs, the Road\u2019s End\u2019s roots, and the Haligtree Village Roofs. It could just be coincidence. The Cave seems like their natural habitat as it flows with a magic river which supports the nearby flora (magic is residual life energy as explained by Sellen\u2019s explanation of Glintstone, as well as the forces behind Ghostflame and the powers of Ancestral Spirits and their followers). \n\nThe Cave is very interesting. We see wolves settle other caves so it seems they all perished but are kept alive by the snails who use them for defense. The disciples, the Inaba, chased Okina after he abandoned them. They sought death through combat, having found it and becoming fodder for the snails. The Godskins are the most thought-provoking inclusion. Their ghosts here would seem to imply some Godskin presence in the Mountaintops some time ago. There is a heavy fiery presence on the Mountaintops; besides the Fire Giants; it\u2019s possible Messmer served here due to the impalement of the giants and the presence of the Giant/Fell mask(s) on the Furnace Golems. Melina lights the Forge and is possibly the Gloam-Eyed Queen. I\u2019m not sure if the cult had a start on the Mountaintops but it might make sense given the fight with the Godskins and the war with the Giants happened early in Marika\u2019s reign. \n\nDon\u2019t remember if I mentioned it, but the Godskins are associated with snakes via one on Gelmir. I suppose the Snakes of this cave can further this connotation; this snaky connotation is further bolstered by the fact both the Godskins and Rykard wish to usurp. \n\nAn early fringe theory I remember is that the Godskins are Eternal City adjacent. Why? A few things. They morph like how quicksilver is described, though there is no shared visual language; there\u2019s also no shared visual language with the Crucible either. If they are kin to Melina it could at least explain some connection since they would be kin to Marika. The main connection is their use of black flame like how the Assassins use the Rune of Death, but the assassins are later, after the failed rebellion; they have a common cause at least. The Godskins are supporting rebelling forces, siding with Rykard (one also defends the death-stricken corpse of Ranni, the main plotter who used the assassins). \n\nSnake-Snails (Snailkes) inherit the broader symbolism of snakes, that being spirituality. The crystal ones contain Glintstone, the skeletal ones breathe wraiths, and the Spiritcallers summon spirits; Eingley contains and amasses spirits, etc\u2026\n\nI forgot to mention earlier, but the Abyssal Serpent of Messmer is also spiritual to some extent. The Furnace Pot says the flames of the Furnace Golems burn away both body and soul. The furnaces feasibly contain a combo of Fell and Abyssal Flame, but given the connotation of the Abyss and Serpents (harkening back to Dark Souls) it would seem the Abyssal Flame is what does the consumption. Flame is very spiritual; the Frenzied Flame similarly destroys souls, the Fell Flame is conducted by the Fell God who lives on through his subjects, Ghostflame destroys bodies and raises spirits, Destined Death\u2019s flames ensure death for body and soul, and the Black Flame is more ambiguous, being the tool of death for the Godskins, but potentially a weaker/ened version of Destined Death. \n\nThis theme of serpentine spirituality goes back to earlier games.\n\n////////\n\nSlugs\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nThe basic slug appears to be wrapped in a blanket of filth, appearing in filthy places themselves. They amass in the pools of the Shaded Castle, the moat around the Capital, the misty woods of the Altus (where they spit Deathblight), the sewers where they squelch in slop and manure, and even in Castle Sol. They typically spit slime to slow you (like a velvet worm) and drop white flesh. They are associated with filth, and perhaps death due to Sol and the woods. \n\nThere are also fire slugs. They appear on Mount Gelmir, but aren\u2019t exclusive to there. They appear near smoldering butterflies which flutter around in some very random areas; they also drop them. A batch can be found near the road to the Limgrave colosseum; to the right of the road leading there, just before the overhead bridge. Another batch is found on the lower plateau southeast of the Church of Vows; Fire Monks camp out here. Another bunch are on the right of the large walkway leading from the Outer Wall Phantom Tree Grace; before the Leyndell main gate walkway. Another bunch are northeast of the Guardian\u2019s Garrison. A bunch more are also found on the right side of the frozen river leading to Theodorix. Who knows if these are a species of their own or just slugs that have adapted to fire? I tried to figure this out via their neighboring butterflies. Smoldering Butterflies are found near fires, but are they the cause of them or merely follow them? I\u2019d say in some cases they follow such as seen with campfires; you\u2019d have to kill them in order to use them to start fires, so I don\u2019t think they intentionally start fires themselves. It\u2019s entirely pointless but are Burning Slugs another species, do fires transform slugs into them; are the butterflies responsible for wildfires; and why are these slugs sometimes found in such random locations? My hypothesizes are: Burning Slugs are a species and cause fires, attracting butterflies; butterflies cause fires and slugs burn in them; both are just attracted to fires (but were they burning before or no?).\n\n///////////\n\nSlimes\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nSlimes are messes of filth and dead flesh. They\u2019re made from necrotic flesh and can contain maggots, feathers, hair, and bones. They have many variants, including poison, rot, blood, lightning, and putrescence. They seem to be creatures that have melted and amassed, yet still live due to the Rune of Death being taken away, such undying devastation being possible because of the Shattering war which has caused \u201cdead\u201d masses to congeal and transform. \n\nWithout access to the roots, and with traditional death being gone, these things amass in squalid conditions where the dead go unburied (Rot brings forward new life). They\u2019re their own living things now. \n\nThe basic kind are found in the squalid muck outside the Murkwater Catacombs, on the ramparts of the Lower Morne Castle, in corners of Redmane Castle, Wyndham Catacombs, and the Consecrated Snowfield. \n\nThe poisonous green kind are found in the pools of the Tombsward Cave and Seethewater Cave. \n\nThe rotten kind can be found in certain areas in Caelid, but prominently in the Minor Erdtree Catacombs. They seem to contain bug shells like those of the Kindred of Rot. \n\nThe bloody kind seem fresh as they are soaked red and covered in blisters. They are found in the Writhblood Ruins, Moghwyn Palace, and Blood Ruins in Nightreign. They may be made of the Dynasty\u2019s victims, perhaps they are ritually soaked to be kept bloody for the mother. \n\nThe lightning kind are found on the Jagged Peak, surging with red lightning. They\u2019re probably made of melted dragon, particularly the Drakes who inherited Bayle\u2019s Lightning. Either that or they\u2019re made of the men who made the climb. Perhaps a mix of both. \n\nThe Putrescence is the remains of ancient beings once contained in the colossal coffins of the Cerulean Coast and Fissure. The flesh is sloppy, wet, and mucky; it doesn\u2019t appear like rotten flesh, instead more like frozen cafeteria slop. I suppose these would form in cold conditions like the fissure; they\u2019ve had time to melt and accumulate. They were burnt by cold Ghostflame in the past (according to the Putrescence Spells), perhaps helping make their melted appearance and color; the conditions are also similar to the Gaols which are lit with Ghostflame and have their own brand of wet amassed flesh (It\u2019s possible the Hornsent were inspired by the practice of the coffins). This flesh is close to the spiritual as well as it can be used to make Piquebone Arrows which conjure shadows where they land, shadows which appear similar to those produced by the Alluring Pot which bears the markings of the Two Fingers, and are made with bone shards and Albinauric Blood; this suggests a spiritual power is behind the \u201cillusion\u201d, and implications regarding Albinaurics; are Albinaurics spiritual due to the \u201csilver\u201d they\u2019re made of? I remember some people suggesting that the putrescence is made of constructed people, like claymen/silver-beings as to explain the illusion and these peoples\u2019 supposed impurity according to the congealed putrescence description (the shadows are similar in appearance to Shadow Bait, a spell of the Two Fingers which suggests they may have some spiritual power, or are at least skilled conjurors; Rhia isn\u2019t far away, and they can create Shadows as servants; according to Recluse\u2019s questline one cannot live without a shadow). Putrescence at least has bones as can be seen by skeletons that animate among it, as well as the Putrescent Knight; to note, its cleaver scales off Arcane; is this due to the nature of putrescence or is it the nature of the corpses? Also to note: Silver Tear weapons do not scale with arcane, but the Silver Tear Mask improves it so\u2026 ehh?\n\n(Archaeology Speculation) The coffins are a curiosity, but are possibly predecessors to the Ancient Dynasty as they depict the same bearded man their statues depict, a bull (which is one of the dynasty\u2019s icons), and they\u2019re depicted at the top of the Dynasty Stelae. The worship of horns is also shared by the Ancestral Followers around the Dynasty ruins and Hornsent who live in the land of the coffins. The stelae also depicts trees as important, so I\u2019d presume some shaman/Hornsent connection here as both worshipped trees (Enir Ilim has trees with faces; the God who entered the gate, Marika, was presumably gifted the Erdtree\u2019s seed by the Two Fingers according to the Seed +1 Talismans; the Hornsent would presumably worship the Two Fingers, seen by the shack outside Rhia and praying corpse in Dheo, as they desired a God); also the Nox settled their cities near these ruins (they are Marika\u2019s relatives). I also have to mention the DLC concept art, that of a coffin atop Rauh\u2026 what does this mean? Were they built atop stuff and then slid down when\u2026 whatever catastrophe that happened\u2026 happened? Be it a fallen star, be it volcanos, the coffins sunk into the stone. \n\nDid the coffins once summon a God? Is that what the Hornsent is basing their massacre upon? The jarred shamans are made of accumulated flesh and can have many faces; they also fire homing flesh, and their title as shamans connotates some spiritual strength, so were they chosen above others to be massacred for being potent spiritual fuel? \n\nI was going to actually talk about Silver Tears and the Molten Tears, but those are an entirely different topic, even if Silver Tears relate to alchemy like snakes, and morph like slime.

His existence or rather what he represents is a surrender to generational hatred and an embrace of original sin itself.\n\nThe sun realm :\n\nThe sun realm is precisely mentioned in ONE item description on a random chance drop shield but it's existence is hinted at constantly and consistently through most of the lands between.\n\nBefore the DLC all we had were a bunch of inconsistent and quite frankly worthless information about a bunch of skeletons and wraiths. But with the robust portrayal of the hornsent we can confidently confirm that : the sun realm did exist, it did dominate the lands between, it practiced storm and divine beast veneration as aspects of the crucible and partook in dragon communion, stuborn clinging to life, it's main fighting force were the banished knights led by commanders Niall and O'Niel (meaning son of Niel or Niall btw) and most importantly it honored death. The sun realm is not necessarily the hornsent but they are it's ideological and cultural center, not all of them need to bear horns.\n\nThe most ancient elden lord we find in the story of the lands between is Placidussax who lies in the storm beyond time at the heart of Farum Azula and the beasts that serve him. Now their wildness and vitality drained away in exchange for the fingers and intelligence granted upon them (descriptions of the cinquedea and beastial vitality). The hornsent worship this storm and venerate it and the beasts who dwell in it and their movements as the most ancient signifier of divinity and primacy. The banished knights, who use these storm innovations, partake in dragon communion to honor the ancient dragons, have dragons on their helmets and were given the choice of either banishment or servitude to Godfrey after his defeat of the lord of stormveil. The ones that accepted still render service to the golden lineage to this day in stormveil serving Godrick, the ones that refused either prowl Farum Azula, or the mountaintops and Caelid as ghosts let by their commanders. In nightreign, the banished knights in the castle even kneel to the horned colosseum lion in front of the gate. The banished knight armor and weaponry even litters practically every major non Carian fort in the lands between. Architectural clues are also very useful here, as Castle Sol is named after the sun, the eclipe imagery is also very clear adding to the sun connotations. Castle morne is also under control of the golden lineage as Castellan Edgar is there under orders of Godrick. \n\nThe sword of castle morne is also a massive hint linking the banished knights, stormveil, the sun realm and the death birds. As the model for the sword without the other blades grafted on top is similar to the death ritual spear and feather branch talisman, not just in design but also in spirit. The spear is the weapon of those accepted by the death birds to strengthen them but also a symbol of the promise of the death birds to repay that companionship with resurrection in the far future. The sword strengthens the user through channeling the spirits of the fallen clan still laying in the grafted blade in promise of vengeance. Stormveil castle also has some fascinating architectural clues as the two towers that look like they have a bite taken out of them near where you find the claw talisman bear a striking resemblance to the divine gate of Enir Illim. The claw talisman also depicts assassins who mimic the deathbirds.\n\nBut the most fascinating clues, are found not found there, they're in the shadow keep. As the shadow keep while not containing any banished knight equipment, holds a mass grave of knights where you fight commander Gaius. The architecture of the shadow keep is also not consistent, meaning some parts were probably built later as older parts more used as civillian ground became abandoned. The most damning part about the shadow keep being older than the war was the boats used to burn the soldier's golden ashes that are one to one the same boats the tibia mariners sail and use to guide the spirits lost in death. The helphen steeple also bears a striking resemblance to the steeples seen in the flooded part of the shadow keep, which should be an older part of the keep, called the church district.\n\nAncient Mesopotamia, again :\n\nEnir Illim, based on Bab-Ellim or Babylon is very clearly meant to reference the tower of Babylon meant to stretch to the heavens and reach God.\n\nIn Mesopotamia, one of the main partners of trade and relations was Dilmun. Dilmun was so important it was part of the Mesopotamian creation mythos as a paradise where there is no disease, predators eat no predators, pain is absent and people do not get old. As such it has several recently unearthed mass burial sites. This mythical land was ruled by the benevolent god Inzak, Anzak, Enzak or as he was known in the initial publications and research... Enshag. Making an interesting tie to the supposed lord of the lost and the desperate whose golden bones still cling to life even after all these years worn as armor by Gideon's lackey who's obsessed with getting the medallion leading to castle sol, Ensha. Clinging to life being necessary to provide a death worth offering to the death birds is a theme that ties Ensha to the death birds, tying all this giant mess into a semi coherent society with a center of culture and different regional practices befitting an empire spanning the whole of the lands between. The gate of divinity being the culmination of generations of spirituality and development into the harvesting of death as a way to create life. Life rises from death as it does from life, and from life through death, one gains power as stated by the remembrance of the regal ancestor. The great hammer given from this remembrance's horns are described as wings to reap the lives of the hornless. The horns of an ancestor spirit continue to bud like antlers as life that experiences no sprouting is offered to it through death creating tangled horns, to the hornsent their proof to be a chosen people. And winged creatures are said to be the envoys of death in ancient pagan faith as said by the winged scythe. The gate of divinity can be therefore assumed to be an attempt at creating the ultimate regal ancestor spirit, a true divine beast, that will reap the life of the hornless, melded harmoniously through shaman women flesh and deliver the hornsent to greater heights. A tradition carried on by Godrick through grafting the dead onto his shaman flesh that harmoniously blends with all others. The spiralhorn shield is therefore one of the earliest depictions and an abservation of the spiral current of the crucible by the primal people of Siofra, the ansestor followers funny enough are still found barely clinging in the lake of rot which poisons the ainsel river and both are massive and ancient burial grounds where corpses are thrown in stone coffins. The old man with the tablet, elden John as some call him in the communtiy, is a representative of the hornsent's ancient people's ancient people studied through the ruins of Rauh. And in his hands he holds a one to one replica of an artifact from Mesopotamia, the imago mundi, or map of the world. Mesopotamia itself means the land between two rivers, in the real world the tigris and euphrates, in elden ring, the ainsel and the siofra. The formless mother, in her infinite kindness to lord Mohg in the sewers, showed him his cursed blood's glorious past leading to his righteous desire to revive it, making him retreat to the ruins underground to learn of his lineage. Elden John has been discussed to death in the communtiy and has been found all over the place, Uld ruins, Rauh ruins, the ancient giant coffins and Enir Ellim. Giving the sun realm much deeper roots than belurat and the tower.\n\nHorah Loux - Serosh / Enkidu - Gilgamesh\n\nBut Mesopotamian mythos and it's connection to Elden ring doesn't end here. Gilgamesh was a prideful despot that the god Enki tried to teach a lesson to in humility to the gods. Enki creates a son then named Enkidu, son of Enki. Enkidu lives as one among beasts like horah loux until he is seduced and screwed into submission by a priestess of ishtar named Shamhat for 7 days and nights straight leading to the depletion of his exess in wildness and his civilization by her hand. Enkidu is then apalled when hearing about Gilgamesh and his actions and goes on to fight him to the death. From that fight is born a deep respect between both of them and Gilgamesh's pride is doubled. He then decides to cement his greatness by slaying the divine beast Humbaba that lives in a forest of giant trees after forging axes to do the deed. Humbaba is killed after Enkidu offers guidance and courage to Gilgamesh but now Enkidu's life is forfait as the gods punish him for the death of Humbaba. Gilgamesh learns beyond grief, and absolutely paralyzing fear of death and goes to the underworld to find a way to gain immortality. He gets in the form of a magical fish, he leaves the underworld and as he celebrates in a bath, his fish is eaten, by a serpent, the serpent then becomes immortal and keeps shedding it's skin every time Gilgamesh tries to kill it or in elden ring terms a serpent never dies. After more depression and monologue, dialogue... Gilgamesh decides to learn humility and instead be immortalised in his deeds through the smiles of his people and the stories they tell about him.\n\nThe hatred of the erdtree towards the serpent from the days of Godfrey here can be understood not only from the biblical sens but also Mesopotamian sens of usurpation of immortality from the king. Besides it's connotations and relations to the fell god, but that needs a whole discertation on its own.\n\nThe whole moral of the story is the acceptance of death by a man and a people that tenaciously and pridefully cling to life.\n\nThe culture of the hornsent while having tones of respect for the elders, the dead and valuing life had their culture slowly turn into a cesspool of hatred, fear of death and denial of their atrocities as specified by the caterpillar mask but also denial of the truth as they imprisoned the lamenter.\n\nTheir curse to turn into flies is fitting divine punishment and proof that the hornsent deeply lacked empathy as the people who cared for the sick never became ill. The mother of flies is excellent at offering punishment and she seems quite fond of showing herself to the horned like the bloodfiends who saw a twisted deity in the visage of their tutelary deity.\n\nThere's even a multitude of theories saying the ritual to ascend to godhood requires death of the lord with good proof as Miquella reproduces this without flaw. So then as the golden prince and a lordling, Godwyn's death would have been necessary for him to ascend as lord of Ranni. His mending rune even evokes a black sun, but Marika's plans to put forth Godwyn as her candidate for lordship in the war she planned ever since she banished Godfrey broke. And through his incomplete death, Godwyn became first of the undead and ruler of those who live in death. A continuation of the sun realm tradition, his resurrection was even planned through a failed eclipse. Mohg even respects this tradition yet challenging Godwyn's ancestral claim by declaring his dynasty the Mohgwyn dynasty. Ansbach, a pureblood knight of Mohg is educated enough in these people's customs that he is able to decipher the rite of ascension to Godhood.\n\nThe hornsent are a very prideful, rotten people who's spirits cling to their descendants and whose ancestors persisting as tutelary deities is an honor. Taylew, a golem that was small, weak and the first one to stop functioning was honored through death into becoming the guardian deity of smithing. Meaning there is genuine power and true honor in being first of the dead, a theme in Miyazaki's older works as well.\n\nThe omen curse : \n\nThe curse of the omen manifests in tangled horns all over the body, a very distinct muscular and monstrous frame and nightmares. Golden black fire like the scadutree is seen attacks by omen with royal blood who still have their horns intact. The hornsent don't exhibit these traits.\n\nMarika was so afraid of the curses of the hornsent that she directed Messmer to be the bearer of this curse in her stead. But as his kindling states, that hatred would not be confined. He even curses her himself for his last words.\n\nIn the dlc one of the first ghosts you see speaks to his dead fellows telling them to keep clinging to their hatred so he can fashion curses from it. The grandam has acess to a wraith spell manifesting rancor, the horned bairn item is similar to the omen bairn in function, the hornsent NPC is eaten alive by his desire for vengeance, the revenger of castle morne clings to the souls of his clan through their blades to grant him strength, Ensha refuses to give up on life, the red and blue branch talismans... there's so many examples of hornsent and sun realm clinging to life beyond death and showing rancor as the result. The hornsent are extremely adept at cursing people, at least that's the conclusion I arrived at.\n\nThe omen curse is not the aspects of the crucible randomly being propped into existence. It's the conclusion of an active effort of a dead people to curse the souls of the people of the erdtree. Through their very bloodlines. The curse, when unleashed by Morgott calls forth a spiral of tarnished, dull red gold that causes a rainstorm to occur. Similar to the divine invocation. Mohg through his acceptance of the formless mother and his cursed blood, is able to channel his plight into wings echoing the very first divine warriors who learned from the birds. To note, the deathbirds, not the death rite birds, have shriveled wings that have a brownish color that fades into a dull yellow and then gray. The twin bird is depicted as both red and blue.\n\nThe dung eater : finally.\n\nThe dung eater when viewed through this context is a manifestation of hatred and the weight that causality holds in the world of elden ring. His armor, exised horns with a large pendant depicting the sun, evokes a desire to embody the very concept of hatred of the golden order and the annihilation of the hornsent at their hands. His barbarity isn't random, he says so himself, that he has to defile every corpse with care, it's ritualistic. His screams even call forth the wraiths similar to the omen and hornsent, a blessing and guidance from his ancestors. He doesn't just want to do it. He feel he has to do it to honor his ansestors restless spirits demanding vengeance, it's a duty.\n\nThe dung eater is a tarnished, not an omen. He is a descendant of a warrior of Godfrey making his link to the sun realm by bloodline quite probable.\n\nA seedbed refers to the genital area of males, more specifically the testes and can be used as euphemism for the general area of the crotch. Dung eater's victims all apear to be exclusively male, with a bloody crotch. So when he says he's cursing your bloodline, he's doing it literally, straight from the source.\n\nHis realisation that he needs to be the recepient of his blessing is a repetition or parody of the jarring of the shamans as instead of self reflection upon the evil act he fully accepts it and even goes through it to ensure his vengeance.\n\nA surrender to hate and cycles of violence and curses, dead in a sewer, after a lifetime of misery inflicted upon others and himself. A grand and brilliant fate to such a storied and deeply rooted civilisation. The karmic dept of the world becoming so deeply entrenched, Marika alone can't bear it, everyone has to bear it's consequence as there is no way to sever causality and the first sin will follow all. Marika through this refuses to let go of the past and embraces letting all the world share in the curses flung at her.\n\nFeel free to give feedback.\n\n\n\n",

Does it go deeper, is there supposed to be something down there, why is it like this?\n\nI believe this has been answered since, in the Great Hollow of Nightreign, there exists a Divine tower where we actually get to see the base of the tower. Each level of the Divine tower gets smaller and smaller, and the base is noticeably thicker than anything in the base game. I also \"climbed\" the tower and found the area where the lift would normally be in the base game.\n\nThe implication of this is that in the base game, we are only seeing a large portion of the top of the tower. The base is seemingly buried. The idea of this isn't new, but it's interesting to think what this could mean for the origin of the Lands Between.",

    "body": "In the cutscene where he asks Radahn to be his consort, he also tells Radahn: \"I'm going to be a God\". I feel like people don't realize what that means. \n\nIf Miquella has already decided he's going to be a god and has set a plan in motion, then at that point he already knows about the ritual scroll. He knows that what is needed is a Lord's \\*\\*soul\\*\\* and a vessel for it. Meaning he already knew Radahn would have to die and is asking him to be his Consort \\*within that context\\*. He just asked Radahn to die. \n\n  \nThere's lore on Radahn's take on his own death, he wants to ensure he dies in honorable combat. He wants someone to kill him as he fights with all his might. He made a vow with Jerren saying this. \n\n  \nThis is what Malenia was doing in the Battle of Aeonia. The Young Lion set confirms this, since it tells us that when Malenia fought Radahn and let the scarlet flower bloom, she whispered in his ear: \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort\". She was there to kill him, per the vow. When she wakes up in the Haligtree she mentions that she is \"awaiting his return\", referring to Miquella. She knows he's off becoming a god and expects him to return with Radahn. \n\n  \nMiquella mentions \"our part of the vow\" in that flashback. That's what their part of the vow was. At the start of the Promised Consort fight, Miquella thanks both Malenia and the Tarnished for killing Radahn. Miquella and Radahn talked about the vow and Radahn agreed under the condition that he could meet his (again, necessary) death in honorable combat. \n\nThe Young Lion Armor has a Haligtree symbol on the cape and we see that during this time in his life, Radahn used the swords of Light and Lord. The descriptions of those swords imply that there's \\*something else\\* besides \"physical strength\" and \"gravity\" that Radahn relies on. It's Miquella. He uses the swords again when he becomes the Promised Consort. \n\nTo preemptively address a popular argument: people get hung up on the wording \"honorable\" combat, saying Malenia wasn't \"honorable\", but I think it just means to kill him while he's fighting his hardest in this case. But even if you don't like that, it's implied that Malenia never intended to go that far in the first place, he was simply so powerful that to kill him she had no choice but to use her hail Mary ult that literally cost her a piece of herself, just to meet his measure. And even doing that she didn't manage to kill him. \n\n  \nI think the vow with Jerren was probably made once the Battle at Aeonia was decided, to have Jerren ensure he dies \\*in combat specifically\\*. Because that's how he wants to die. ",

It\u2019s just the way things went. Truthfully, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s who I am at all.\n\nIf I\u2019m being honest, what I really think; I\u2019m nobody. I\u2019m nothing. I don\u2019t have much family, and all of my friends have their own.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019ve ever done of any value in this life is bring people entertainment with my clips and my lore posts. \n\nSo maybe who I am is the Limgrave Butcher, and what I do is entertain the people who love these games just as much as I do.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be. Just a blip. \n\nI often daydream about a reality where I\u2019m somebody more than what I really am. A reality in which I\u2019m not just bringing a smile to dozens of people\u2019s faces; but to everyone on this planet who needs one. But I know I\u2019ll never live up it.\n\nSo thank you, for enjoying my posts. Even the ones where I\u2019m being silly. You may be the only meaning my life will ever have.\n\nIn my introspection I wonder, is that the point of these games? To be somebody more than what you could ever dream to be.\n\nElden Ring isn\u2019t a great video game because it\u2019s open world Dark Souls, or because it has excellent bosses. It\u2019s a great game because you are looking into a mirror.\n\nNot only does the story of Elden Ring reflect the history of our own world. It lets you choose how you would rule the world.\n\nBut for you to understand the choice you are making, you have to understand the default ending. \n\nIt\u2019s not super complicated, you mend the Elden Ring as close as you can to imitate the Golden Order. You won\u2019t ever live up to the Golden Order, but\u2026 well, you\u2019ve all played Dark Souls. It\u2019s merely a cycle.\n\nBut what does mending the Elden Ring in a default state mean? Well, look at the world around you. \n\nThe Golden Order was an undoubtedly a critique of the rise and the worldwide domination of Christian Capatalism. It is a critique of Amarika. And it\u2019s also a warning. \n\nThe Original Sin of Marika isn\u2019t so far off from Eves Original Sin.\n\nMetyr is the serpent that seduced Eve into usurping God. Once a child of God, she was abandoned, and so she became vengeful. \n\nThe Golden Order subjugates the Pagans through violence, they even use their own symbolism against them. They believe in one true god, they believe they are above the natural law. Marika is Crucified similarly to Jesus Christ.\n\nMarika has monopolized life and death. She created the Erdtree so that she could control who lived and who died based on how useful to the system they were. People could only have true death if they were accepted into the system. Kinda sounds like Heaven and Hell. \n\nBut it all backfired on her. The Omens arent just Hornsent descendants. They are the new, cursed Hornsent. A brutish reminder of the Crucible. The natural world fights back.\n\nAnd the most devastating blow to Marika, Godwyn. \n\nThe game states that the Shattering happened because of Godwyn. The lore community took this as an emotional reaction. I think it\u2019s a reaction of desperation. \n\nMarika didn\u2019t shatter the Elden Ring because she was sad that her son died. Fucking hell, Marika literally says \u201cif you are my son or daugher and you don\u2019t become anything then you will be SACRIFICED.\u201d \n\nMarika shattered the Elden Ring to stop Godwyn from usurping her. Deathblight overwrote Erdtree Burial. She didn\u2019t just lose her son, she lost control. \n\nMarika thought herself above death, she wanted to control it. But death isn\u2019t a belief. Death is life. \n\nRot; and Death may have been suppressed because of the removal of Destined Death, but the concepts didn\u2019t stop existing. They mutated into a twisted version of their natural state when given the chance. \n\nSpeaking of which, Fias ending was one of death restored. Not just Destined Death. But Deathblight as well. In Marikas attempt to weaken death, she made it significantly stronger. \n\nFia is the antichrist of Elden Ring. The one who would bring about the end of the Golden Order on a literal fundamental level. She is NOT bringing the world back to its natural state. \n\nDeathblight and Destined Death have the same source, but they are not the same thing. \n\nDestined Death was life and death controlled by the Greater Wills fate. With Deathblight you are God. You are the life and death within one vessel. You can\u2019t rot, you are no longer bound by the natural state. \n\nIf Deathblight was natural, it wouldn\u2019t be weak to Golden Order Fundamentalism which is a scientific study of the Greater Will.\n\nI believe you could most easily compare The Age of the Duskborn to Satanism. You are still within the order, but you become your own personal Greater Will. It\u2019s a story of self empowerment.\n\nBelieve it or not, the Dungeater is also a twisted part of Order. \n\nThe Age of Despair is the revenge of the Hornsent upon the Golden Order. In this ending you are forcing the entire world to be equally cursed together. Likely symbolic of Communism, we are all in it together equally. \n\nA lot of people view Goldmasks ending to be a continuation of the Golden Order. And to that end, you are both right and wrong. The Golden Order isn\u2019t just a religion, it is a science, it is as political stance!\n\nGoldmask does not abandon the science behind the Golden Order. He abandons the religion behind it. While he is still a Fundamentalist, he loses his faith in Marika and the Gods. Goldmask is an Agnostic Atheist. Order that isn\u2019t dictated\nby faith, but by science. \n\nThe last 2 endings are my favorite and by far the most complex.\n\nRannis Age of Stars is Anarchy. She spent her entire life controlled by Marikas Golden Order. I think in this way many of us can sympathize with her. But her circumstances were not that of a normal person; So she grew up not to hate Golden Order, but Order itself.\n\n\u201cThe certainties of sight, emotion, faith, will all become impossible. As it is now Souls and Order tightly bound, but I would have them at great remove.\u201d \n\nIn Rannis ending, we send the Elden Ring to the Stars. This is symbolic of us losing control over order. While it\u2019s true that Ranni is a love interest, it\u2019s important to see the bigger picture. The community didn\u2019t see this; So they added into the DLC this: \u201cOnze realized that the Procession of the Stars ended in ruin\u201d\n\nProcession: Follow in an orderly fashion. \n\nOrderly Fashion means the Elden Ring.\n\nThe Elden Ring ending up with the stars ends in ruin. Anarchy isn\u2019t really an option at the end of the day.\n\nNightreign shows us this. While the world may burn, Order has merely been abandoned; not destroyed entirely.\n\nThe abandonment of Order would be the Frenzied Flame. This is the nuclear option. You are not changing Order; Nor are the you abandoning it. You are destroying it completely. What is, will become naught. \n\nThis ending wouldn\u2019t even be an option if the world wasn\u2019t in the state it was in. This isn\u2019t just comically evil nihilism. This is cosmic balance. Karma. The consequence of an unfixable fundamental imbalance forced into the system. \n\nGo back and play the Ds3 DLC. We literally are the FF. The old order is desperately clinging onto power, and we are tasked with burning it all away so a new world can be born. \n\nI guess if I had to choose I would pick Goldmasks ending.",

    "body": "Imma speculate on where you find these and other lore about them. Here we go!\n\n**Cerulean Crystal Tears**\n\nRestores half of FP. We learn a) that the sap of erdtrees has the capacity to restore spiritual energy. We can acquires two of these, and when using the both, we restore all of our FP.\n\nThis 'two cerulean tears each giving half FP back' phenomenon seems to me to be a satisfying piece of evidence for 'two tree theory', which is the notion that in the distant past, there were supposed to be two erdtrees reigning over the LB (perhaps a tree of life and a tree of death). This second tree might be a spiraling tree around the Erdtree we know, or perhaps a tree to the far north (which is what I ascribe too).\n\nThe Haligtree is meant to 'be an erdtree', so we know this rival tree creation is possible to some degree. We even fight an erdtree avatar in Elphael, confirmation that the tree, even in its current state, is to some degree a proper 'erdtree' (or maybe it was in the past). \n\nWe find the left-facing Cerulean tear on the Western bank of Liurnia by a Minor Erdtree. Liurnia is the most 'spirit' energy-rich region, so I assume it is there by environmental causality. The western bank 'has always been associated with the Carian royals', implying extra moon-magic power for the whole region. It comes with the ruptured crystal tear, perhaps a clue that the modern Erdtree has lost its spiritual aspect.\n\nWe find the right-facing Cerulean tear on the Eastern peak of the Mountaintop of the Giants. We must find the duplicating Erdtree Avatar (two trees!). It comes with the crimson bubble tear (spirit and body, two trees!). These locations and instances of duality seem like further evidence for two-tree theory.\n\nThat we get a repeated tear in the North furnishes a hypothesis: the minor erdtrees in the mountaintops were grown from the Haligtree, or whatever tree it was before it was the Haligtree. Let's see if this receives further support.\n\n**Cerulean Hidden Tear**\n\nThis tear eliminates FP cost for a brief period of time. \n\nThe environmental storytelling looms large. We go down a slope of hanging troll corpses bleeding into the ground, past a wailing wormface, and reach the dying minor Erdtree only to meet an ulcerated tree spirit. These spirits almost always manifest around roots (rather than trees). The lack of avatar and presence of the spirit tells us just as much has been done to this minor erdtree. Has Rykard desecrated it out of malice? Or it he experimenting on it?\n\nSince, lacking an avatar, a 'spirit' forms, I'd imagine the Cerulean Hidden Tear is a spiritual manifestation produced upon this minor erdtree's death.\n\nGelmir is just above Caria Manor and has many architectural similarities with Raya Lucaria. Perhaps it used to be an astrologer hub back in the day.\n\n**Cerulean Sapping Cracked-Tear**\n\nThe DLC tears tell us something interesting, which is that tree-sap is not in any way antithetical to being put inside a forge and cooked. The glistening golden sap of the Scadutree... was it once in a giant forge? \n\nThis one restores FP upon attacking. We have a tree-looking fragment in the picture of the tear and swirly lines going into it - so a tree that is absorbing spiritual energy, that we end up behaving like. \n\nThis is an odd effect, unique (I think) in the game. There are several things that grant FP restoration upon death (Sword of Milos, Sacrificial Axe, and the Ancestral Spirit Horn). FP upon death means you siphon the spirit freed from its vessel. The spirit horn is a powerful vessel for the spirit; the Sword of Milos is perhaps, in some way, a living entity that still hungers; the Sacrificial axe is related to Ancient Death Culture that involves recycling and redistribution of souls and energy. \n\nCloser still is the Assassin's Cerulean Dagger. It restores FP upon critical hit. Perhaps in a strike so violent, some spirit can be gleaned... The Assassin's have all sort's of enchantments related to occult Destined Death rituals... Perhaps Destined Death operates by full absorption of vital life and spirit, so even a partial enchantment can grant such a powerful effect. \n\nThis Scadutee sap effect is stronger still. Its sapping effect is far more potent than the others described. \n\nSince the sapping is related to death/freeing the spirit from its vessel/Destined Death, then all I can conclude is that the Scadutree is uniquely close in nature to 'death of the spirit'. Whatever that means. Any ideas?\n\nOh, and you get it by Manus Metyr so the Carian's are close to this Cerulean tear as well. They really are the Cerulean faction.\n\nI'll do crimson's next time. Hope you had fun!",

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "I'm surprised no one really talks about this, but the exact location of Farum Azula was just about certainly in Dragonbarrow. Im not usually one to call my theories fact, but this seems certain to me. Maybe I missed somebody already finding this? \n\nThe biggest piece of it all is that Farum Azula fits the \"bay\" of Dragonbarrow like a puzzle piece. The blue line is the coastline of the bay for a clearer view. \n\nI included the second photo of the two nearby but disconnected to show the shape a little clearer, and I included the third to show that when looked at together on the same map the size still lines up, to prove I didn't tweak the scale to fit my idea or anything. \n\nThen there's the environmental and story evidence. The first and strongest is the Bestial Sanctum and Farum Greatbridge. The name of the bridge is of course a connection, but its design is identical to that of the architecture of Farum Azula. The beast reliefs, the patterning, the brasiers, the floors, all of it. \n\nThe Sanctum itself contains Gurranq, who of course is Maliketh, and so by this theory the Sanctum is right next to the arena where we fight Maliketh. The architecture of the Sanctum is again identical to that of Farum Azula, even the pillars outside the building contain the same beastman graves and are marked with the same patterns. \n\nThere's also the fact that dragonbarrow is the home of the Drakes, who are descendants of the Ancient Dragons. The term \"barrow\" can mean a burial mound, and in fact in FA we see ancient dragons embedded into the stone which would have previously been underground. FA itself is after all a massive burial structure. \n\nAnd the Sanctum is guarded by both Black Blade Kindred, who serve Maliketh, and by footsoldiers who wield Maliketh's claw attack and Destined Death. \n\nWe can also look at how the Beastman of Farum Azula bossfight is right on this same coast, and that a Godskin Apostle is in the Divine Tower which would have flanked the West face of FA in this model. \n\nWhen you look at FA, you will see that the southern border is higher up and has many bridges extending outward - and in this model these bridges would have reached to the cliffs of Caelid, where the Minor Erdtree is. \n\nAll of these environmental clues occur on exactly the coastline that fits FA like a puzzle piece. \n\nAnd if you look at the northern face of FA, you will notice it is much lower and even appears to have a building that could have touched water once. So the altitude gradient even matches up in the correct way. \n\nThe word Farum itself is Latin for \"lighthouse\", which implies a coastal city, which in this model, FA is. \n\nThere's one last interesting tidbit, which is that on the southwestern jut of FA, which fits snugly into the jut of bay east of the Divine Tower of Caelid, there is a pond which has a waterfall pouring off of the edge. And if we look at that same spot in Caelid...\n\nThere is a pond close by with two drakes which contains gravel stones, an item which is specifically said to only be found in places where the ancient dragons once were. As if these stones poured down the waterfall through \"time\" and gathered in this pond - the two are the same body of water. \n\nThis model also explains why the Dragonbarrow peninsula is such an irregular jut of land, if FA were once in the bay to its left then the coastline is filled in more naturally. \n\nI also have a lot of dense nonsense about how all of this ties into Radahn and his ressurection, but I'll save it.\n\nThis seems pretty definitive to me and I just wanted to make a coherent piece about it. Thanks for reading! ",

Knowing that Millicent and her sisters are all clones of Malenia, all of them having the same face has to be intentional.\n\nThe last time I analyzed Melina I noticed that her face reminded me a lot of Marika's face in Ranni's ending, and the more I looked the more incredulous I became, IT'S SO SIMILAR, and if Melina is in fact a child of Marika born asexually it would make a lot of sense for them to have the same face, it's the same genetic material.\n\nSo I decided to put the pieces together myself and...

It just goes to prove two things: that the Erdtree and the people of the Golden Order have truly rewritten history and painted themselves as the only force of good, rejecting all whose ideals have even a hint of contrast to those of Marika, and later Radagon (after Marika herself starts to doubt the GO).\n\nSir Ansbach's relationship with Mohg alone proves that Mohg must have had the same sense of honour as Ansbach, otherwise Mohg wouldn't be deserving of his loyalty. But how can this be so, given Mohg's sinister appearance and intentions? Gideon tells us that Mohg plans to turn as many Tarnished as possible into bloody fingers, slaying their own kind in the name of the Outer God of blood. Sounds pretty evil. However, Mohg is doing this to establish his own order, after seeing the fickleness and corruption of the one he was born into. Blood and loss of blood are fundamental aspects of the cycle of life and death, and this is likely why Mohg is painted in such a bad light - because the concept of death has been forbidden and is considered a sin according to the Golden Order. At their core, Mohg's ideals are one of peace and the natural cycle of life and death, revering blood - the very thing we're all made of - above all else. This has got to be the basis on which his blood pact with Ansbach is built, to restore nature to it's original state, for the good of all living things. And they are only killing Tarnished that follow the Golden Order i.e. seek the Elden Throne to continue enforcing the will of Marika/Radagon.\n\nAlas, Mohg's age of lifeblood would never come to pass, after he was brainwashed by Miquella in order to establish the age of oppression, disguised as compassion. Yet another order based around blind loyalty.",

    "body": "Only those loved by dragons can imbue their bodies with lightning and remain alive.\n\nGodwyn became friends with Fortissax, this is an important point in the story, so although without direct confirmation the game gives us enough evidence to believe that Godwyn probably used lightning and was therefore loved by Fortissax. Not to mention that Fortissax was by Godwyn's side even in his most deplorable state trying to cure him of Deathblight even if it was ineffective.\n\nLansseax was Fortissax's sister and took a human form to commune with knights, and among all of them, Vyke was the one that Lansseax loved the most, and so Vyke can use her dragonbolt.\n\nA third case also occurs, this time with us, the player. We can experience this personally with Florissax. Florissax is a very strange case, we put her to sleep, causing her to be abandoned by Placidusax and now, fallen and without purpose, she no longer considers herself an Ancient Dragon. \n\nHowever, when we tell her that we were the ones who put her to sleep, she becomes momentarily enraged, but she will soon calm down and then ask us to be her Lord in return.\n\nLet's agree that this is at least... strange.\n\nBut things started to make more sense when I saw the order of events, first Florissax is abandoned, then we tell her that we killed Bayle, she will be very grateful and will GIVE US HER DRAGONBOLT, then later we tell her the truth.\n\nThe moment we told her that we were the reason for her banishment, she was already loving us.\n\n And this is true when you consider that she is one of the few characters who voluntarily decides to become a Spirit Ash to be by our side (I think the only other one who also does this is Latenna). Not to mention that the description of her Dragonbolt says that she never used this incantation because she never knew love before, but when we summon Florissax, she uses it.\n\nAll of the above is a conclusion drawn from the item descriptions and character lines, but now comes the speculative part... \n\nHow does the Ancient Dragons' love work?\n\nYou can clearly see that it is very different from the type of love we are used to, it seems to be something exclusive between Ancient Dragons and Humans, we do not have any love affair between two Ancient Dragons, Florissax served Placidusax but did not have any love for him.\n\nAnd I have a very interesting theory as to why this happens. Ancient Dragons are literally made of stone, they feel nothing, when asking Florissax about Igon, she responds that he is the perfect idea of what Placidusax wanted for the dragon communion, Igon has very strong feelings, his hunger, his anger and ambition are things that beings as ancient as the Ancient Dragons do not understand, they do not feel it.\n\nTherefore, there are no feelings between Ancient Dragons, but what would happen if you put an Ancient Dragon in the midst of several beings as sensitive as humans?\n\nLove is what happens, a somewhat distorted love, because they don't understand this feeling, but still, they surrender to it.\n\nDespite all the sweetness, the love of Dragons seems to follow a pattern, the beloved is always the strongest:\n\nGodwyn, beloved by Fortissax, was probably the strongest demigod without a Great Rune.\n\nVyke, beloved by Lansseax, was the one who came closest to becoming Elden Lord\n\nAnd the Tarnished is literally the strongest being in the Lands Between.\n\nI took some time to put this all together, thanks for reading.

But the description is quite interesting, because it openly says that this is not something natural, it is a gift from an outer god, and this is reflected in its power, instead of the corroded metal becoming more fragile, it becomes stronger. \n\nYou may have heard how wine gets better with age, this isn't because the wine isn't rotting, it is, just gracefully.\n\nI believe this is exactly how Rot works, or used to work before the crusade. When Messmer and his soldiers invaded the Shadowlands and burned everything, the Rot found Romina and took pity on her while Romina found the Rot and changed it into something now baleful, it's as if the rot has adapted to Romina herself.\n\nIt's starting to make more and more sense why Scarlet Rot's weakness is fire. Messmer had already given the hint.",

But when I arrived at the Bestial Sanctuary and read the descriptions of the Bestial Incantations, it seemed I was mistaken and had misinterpreted the Beastmen's twisted designs. Now I know I was right all along.\n\nBeastmen are not Beasts who gained intelligence along with a fifth finger.\n\nThe Beastmen who gained their intelligence long ago are those we find embedded in the architecture of Farum, whether as a punishment, a sacrifice, or an extraordinary burial method. The same beasts that are represented on the unique chests of Farum Azula. The same beasts sculpted on Bernalh's armor.  The same species to which Maliketh and perhaps Serosh possibly belong.\n\nIf we read the descriptions in both English and Japanese, of all the Beast-related objects, from Bernalh's armor to the beast enchantments, including the Cinquedea dagger, whose hands closely resemble those of the walled Beasts, all of them exclusively use the term \"Beast\" (\u7363) when referring to those creatures.\nWhile the objects that clearly belong to the Beastmen and are mentioned use \"Beastman\" (\u7363\u4eba).\n\nFinally, as a final piece of evidence, the living skeletons of the Beastmen leave human bones when defeated, proving that they are not truly beasts in origin, but humans who have undergone a feral transformation.\n\nWhen designing characters, it's very important that they convey their entire story just by looking at them. The beastmen don't convey the idea of \u200b\u200ban animal that has gained consciousness, but rather that of a human who has undergone a metamorphosis. Serosh and Maliketh look as animals that have gained the ability to speak and think.",

    "body": "This post is merely my theory concerning the events that happened at the Divine Gate during Marika's ascension(Disregarding the seduction and betrayal as well as the creation of gold and shadow. That belongs to a whole other post) and where is her lord during the ritual.\n\n# The Information Told To Us About The Gate's Past\n\n\" *The tower of shadow houses a divine gateway. A well-kept secret, it was, but\u2026 The gateway was once the birthplace of a god. A god we know all too well.\"*\n\nThis dialogue from Ansbach confirms that Marika became a god at the gateway. An event we seem to see during the story trailer for the dlc where Marika seems to ascend at a gateway with bloody corpses unlike the ashen ones that they are now.\n\n***\"****Twinblade symbolizing abundance. The secret treasure of the tower.*\n\n*Though the blades, fashioned from golden shoots, are largely wilted and darkened, their luster can be restored by dealing damage to foes.*\n\n*However, damage dealt to Those Who Live in Death will have no such effect.\"*\n\n*\"Using the power of the vortex, violently twirl the armament, dealing multiple slashes directly ahead. The greater the restored luster of the blades, the greater the power of this skill.\"*\n\nThis item, while not stated to be directly about the gate, is most likely the one that informs the player how the gate was made and why it works. Elden Ring has long had a theme about life coming from death(Mostly examine the Ancestor spirits and their followers for more details).This twinblade informs us that the hornsent too knew this truth. A truth that they used to make the divine gate. The power taken from the life of others can be used to power a vortex(something that is linked to the crucible) to create a spiral that will reach the realm of the gods. This is why the twinblade's effect does not work Those Who Live in Death as only the living can be used to fuel the vortex.\n\n*\"The spiral is a normalized Crucible current that, one day, will form a column that stretches to the gods.\"*\n\n# The Secret Rite Scroll\n\n***\u201c****A scroll made of white tree bark.*\n\n*Few can decipher the scroll,*\n\n*which describes the secret rite of the divine gateway*\n\n*said to be found at the tower enshrouded by shadow.*\n\n*\"A lord will usher in a god's return,*\n\n*and the lord's soul will require a vessel.\u201d*\n\nThis is the one, and only, item in the entire game that talks about the gate\u2019s ritual. Now let's break it down:\n\n1.A lord will usher in a god\u2019s return. This is not surprising to base game players. It seems like an immutable fact that a god needs a lord(Placidusax with his nameless god, the tarnished with Ranni, and Marika needing a lord with Godfrey, Radagon, and the Tarnished. There are even the Outer Gods showing the tendency of having a lord with the Lord of Frenzied Flame and Mohg as the Lord of Blood). The scroll seems to suggest that a lord is needed for a god to return from the gate.\n\n2.The Lord's soul will require a vessel. This is a most curious line as it could be interpreted in many ways. The one I believe is that this is purely talking about Radahn. This would track as the quoted text is most likely from either Miquella or Ansbach and not something actually on the scroll as it states that few can decipher the scroll. It would make sense that the quote is either from the empyrean planning to use the gate or the man that actually can decipher the scroll for you.\n\nHowever the community has noticed a very important problem with this quote. While the lord's soul part can be ignored as something solely referring to Radahn, there is the problem concerning the first part of the quote. As far as we know, Godfrey nor anyone else was present at the gate during the ritual. While some people have theorized that Radagon is the lord, I doubt it as it feels like a cop out as well as somewhat contradicting the quote. The lord's soul needs a vessel. I highly doubt that Radagon could be the required lord when he shares a vessel with Marika. That's not even going into the fact that Godfrey is her first lord and how Radagon isn't a figure in the lore until the Carian Wars. He is also never mentioned anywhere in the entire dlc so it makes it unlikely that he was a relevant figure at all in The Land of Shadows.\n\nNow that begs the question. Where is Marika\u2019s lord during her ascension?\n\n**There isn't one, as Marika did not have a lord during the ritual.**\n\n# The Divine Invocation\n\nMarika has no lord during her ascension to godhood. She doesn't need one. After all, she does not enter the gate unlike Miquella. Miquella comes through the gateway when Radahn finally returns during the second phase cutscene. He is leaving the gate from somewhere else. Marika does not ever enter the gateway as it seems that something beyond the gate responded to her with its roar(and the game playing its music with its chorus after the roar to make it clear what it was). This seems to be the moment that the Elden Beast joined with Marika in a form of divine invocation, similar to the Divine Beast being some entity that possesses the sculpted keepers. In this scenario, she is the one ushering in a god's return. She is dragging down a god in the most sacred form of Divine Invocation. Just like the hornsent's rituals and their hope of a spiral being able to reach the gods.\n\n# Elden Ring\n\n\u201cIt is said that long ago,\n\nthe Greater Will sent a golden star bearing a beast into the Lands Between,\n\nwhich would later become the Elden Ring\u201d.\n\nThis text makes it quite clear that the Greater Will wasn't always the Elden Ring, and seeing how the Elden Ring still exists after we kill the beast the Elden Ring can exist in all its power without the Elden Beast. However we can speculate on where it came from and how it came to be:  \n  \n**Farum Azula**\n\nThe infamous Elden Ring mural which depicts the Elden Ring in a manner that is not seen elsewhere in the game. Now while this doesn't mean much on its own due to Maliketh being in the room, another description gives it a whole other meaning\n\n*\u201cThe Dragonlord whose seat lies at the heart of the storm beyond time*\n\n*is said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the Erdtree.*\u00a0\n\n*Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return.\u201d*\n\nPlacidusax was said to be Elden Lord. A title that only belongs to someone that was the lord of the Elden Ring's Vessel. In order for him to be called that, he has to have some connection to The Elden Ring during his age. Now we do run into many interesting issues with this title. Not only is Godfrey called The First Elden Lord, but nothing else refers to Placidusax as being an Elden Lord. Not even his own priestess refers to him as such. She only uses his title as Dragonlord. Why is the only time that the Elden Ring is ever brought up is when it is during Marika\u2019s age?\n\n**The Elden Ring was not in effect during Placidusax\u2019s reign for it was never finished.**\n\n# The Construction of The Elden Ring\n\nLet's take a step back for a moment to answer a question.   \n  \nHow was the Elden Ring made?  \n  \nThankfully the Story Trailer for the dlc does explain it. During the trailer we see Marika pull golden threads from a corpse and we later see her with many of these threads once the Elden Beast responds to her. Said threads bear similarity to the strands of gold that are on Marika\u2019s hammer during the shattering of the Elden Ring. Marika, at the gate, creates a rune using these threads. A rune that was missing from the Farum Azula mural.\n\n*\u201cThe lower arc of the Elden Ring is held to be the basin in which its blessings pool.\u201d*\n\nThe Rune Arc of the Elden Ring, the rune that is most commonly associated with Marika, was created at the gate. The rune that is needed for the blessings of the Elden Ring to be collected. This might be why Placidusax\u2019s reign is never attributed to The Elden Ring as the ring never had the rune that was needed to harness its blessings.\n\n\n\n# Farum Azula\u2019s Failure\n\nThe city of Farum Azula has a major similarity to Enir-Ilim. They are both built using corpses with the only difference being that the people of Farum Azula put their bodies to rest unlike the Hornsent who seem to just stick them anywhere they can. With them also sharing the phenomenon of it always being day. I propose that Farum Azula used the corpses of the beastmen to create the Elden Ring and tried to do the same ritual as Miquella. For the god to take the Elden Ring into the heavens and to create a foundation for a new age:\n\n*\u201cThe circlet of light which adorned Miquella's head as he returned in divine aspect. It has begun to fade into nothingness.*\n\n*Slightly boosts intelligence, faith, and arcane, while also boosting the power of Miquella's light.*\n\n*This circle was to be the very foundation upon which Miquella's age of compassion would be built, should it have ever come to pass.\u201d*\n\nMiquella returned from the gate in a divine aspect with a new foundation for his age. He would not use the Elden Ring which was used to create the casualty and division that he loathed. He would instead use his circlet as the foundation. A foundation that is even seen when using his divine spell and when he tried to put the Tarnished under his sway.\n\nNow to answer the question of what actually happened at the Divine Gate that made Marika's ascension so unique compared to her child\u2019s.\n\n\u201c*Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return.\u201d*\n\nPlacidusax is awaiting for his god to return. A god(for this point onward I am going to assume that Placisusax\u2019s god is the Elden Beast. It doesn't really matter who the god was for the sake of this theory as the original vessel could have been lost on whatever plane is beyond the gate) who Marika finds to already be on the other side with the majority of the Elden Ring. I propose that Placidusax and his god tried to do the same ritual at the gate to make the Elden Beast/Vessel into a god and the Elden Ring into a foundation. However, Placidusax fails to usher in his god\u2019s return either due to something that was wrong with him or Bayle interrupted the process(Which is why he was able to inflict such grievous harm upon the lord without interference from his kin).\u00a0\n\nMarika, either on accident or through the meddling of the fingers, creates a brand new rune and draws forth the god that is already on the other side. After all, Marika is only a god due to being the carrier of the vessel's vision. This also why Radagon is a god when he is turned into a sword as he is now the carrier of the vision now.\n\n*\"Queen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision.\u00a0A god, in truth.\"*\n\nThis might also why Marika was broken at the end of her age wanting to end it all. She was never a god, just a vessel for the true god of the Greater Will to spread Order throughout the Lands Between. She was merely seduced by the fingers to only be betrayed in the end. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nMarika\u2019s ascension did not have a lord. She performed a form of divine invocation that draw forth the Elden Beast that was stuck on the other side due to a failed attempt of the ritual by Placidusax.\n\n",

But he is not a hornsent, is he?\n\nWell, when we fight Hoarah Lou we find out how \"Godfrey\" really used to fight: with his bare hands.

So this kind of fighting style was originally crested by horned warriors!\n\nFinally, the craziest thing I found out. I think that most of the people that are reading this are thinking: \"dude, Godfrey doesn't have horns\". But maybe I used to... We know that it is possible to loose one's horns, before Morgott's death his horns disappear, probably thanks to the grace of the Erdtree. I think that Godfrey used to have horns and the proof was right in fron of us: a horn is growing out of his head in his depiction on the talisman of lord's bestowal (while the right half of his hair is long and white/golden, the left side has a horn growing). Maybe he lost his horns when he accepted the sap (changing sides in a way) and maybe the reason that his children are omen is more direct that we thought because he used to be a hornsent.",

The translation was a mix of Google translate and Wiktionary to double check. But I have seen others translate it the same way, so it seems right and the theory doesn't rely on it anyways.)\n\nIf you look at the sigil upside down, you can *kind of* see a very stylised hand, with the swirl being black flame, if you squint.\n\nBut imo it looks more like the spell Black Flame. A fistful of black flame thrown through the air. A ball tapering towards one end.\n\nEither way, both seem like likelier options than Metyr.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis interpretation of the symbol makes much more sense to me than Metyr's face, for these three reasons:\n\nIt doesn't straight-up contradict the description of the godslayer's seal.\n\nThe Metyr-face theory is often based on an idea that the Fingers were favouring the GEQ over Marika, but there is no evidence that Metyr or the Fingers in general were more involved with the GEQ than any other empyrean.\\\nRanni says about the Empyreans that: *\"Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers\"*.\n\nThe swirl/gemstone bear no resemblance to Metyr's eye, lacking the very distinctive clover-like pattern.\\\nAnd there is really nothing else on Metyr's face that it could be. Not her fingerprint, that is what the rest of the symbol supposedly is and how would a piece of obsidian represent it.\\\nBut it could be churning black flames. The Godslayer's Greatsword (img 5) already represents flame with swirls (technically not confirmed, but just look at it) and then the obsidian actually makes sense as a replacement.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso Metyr \u2260 GEQ.\n\nMetyr has no black flame attacks and is described as just vacantly gazing into the beyond, waiting for another message from the GW.\n\nShe is passive, waiting, not leading a crusade against the gods and somehow birthing human(oid)s instead of fingers.\n\nHer eye is also not gloam, it's reddish.\\\nGloam doesn't have a confirmed colour, but it's almost certainly not red.\nEspecially since the internal name of the putrescent knight is gloam-eyed knight and it has blue eyes.\\\nAnd in Nightreign, Ironeye has purple eyes and gains a glowing blue eye via his remembrance quest. Ironeye is one of TWLiD, being undead due to small fragments of half of a shard of the Rune of Death.\\\nThe beast eye that seeks out deathroot is also purple, as are the eyes of Blaidd, a **shadow** bound beasts.\\\nGhostflame is a pale blue.\\\nBlack flame is black.\\\nThe Black Knives and Black Blade are specifically black.\\\nThe Blasphemous Claw has a black gash (same for the Black Knives, the Black Blade. And the RoD looks like one)\nIn the 1.0 version of the game Maliketh's parriable Destined Death attacks were purple.\\\nAll deathblight related things are black, or black and gold/yellow.\\\nTibia Mariners are purple.\\\nSpirits are various shades of blue or teal, sometimes white/grey.\\\nSleep is light-purple. The velvet poison of eternal sleep is deep-purple. Sleep, especially eternal sleep is not too unlike death and Trina is specifically found in the most death filled area of the game.\n\nDeath is almost always associated with black, purple, or blue. \n\nAlthough admittedly sometimes it is red:\\\nThe RoD is half red, half black.\\\nWhen Tibia Mariners and the horn blowing albinaurics in Mogh's swamp summon skeletons and the big spirit skeletons, the horns glow red. (Arguably life instead of death)\\\nThe lamplight of the Helphen is red.\n\nAnd thats kind of it for red death-stuff.\\\nDeath is overwhelmingly black, black and white, blue, or purple, and very occasionally silver.\n\nMetyr's eye is not gloam.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hope you liked reading this.\n\nIf you hated it, I don't really know what to say in response to that.

Other than the Blade of Calling and it's location, there is no evidence of a past life or any history of her in the Lands Between or the Shadow Lands.\n* She was born in the Erdtree, and was given a purpose by her \"mother\". That purpose was to act as a Finger Maiden to Marika's chosen Tarnished, and to eventually act as kindling to set the Erdtree on fire using the Flame of Ruin. \n* She moves and fights like a Black Knife Assassin, and wields a similar weapon that may have been what a Black Knife was prior to being infused with Destined Death. Marika had close ties with the Black Knife Assassins.\n* She can cast Marika's secret Minor Erdtree incantation. \n* She can recall Marika's words/echoes at several sites of grace. \n* She can convert our runes into strength. \n* She has close ties to Torrent, who was previously owned by Marika, not Miquella (I'm sorry, but I also strongly believe this is true)\n\n**More Speculative Evidence**\n\n* Millicent's quest intentionally tells us enough to understand the relationship between Marika and Melina.

They also wear the same outfit and have the same amnesia plot-driven storyline.\n* When Melina comments on Boc crying and says \"*Does being born of a mother... Mean one behaves in such a manner*?\", this is a hint that Melina was not traditionally born of a mother.\n* The Radagon Problem. Melina has strawberry-blonde hair and would be a younger version of Marika.. Admittedly, it's not much to go on, but I think that Radagon and Marika were once one person and split at a later point in the timeline. Either this, or Radagon was a completely separate person who later merged with Marika.\n* I know a lot of people believe that Melina is the GEQ. This theory doesn't disprove that. I actually believe that Marika once donned the title of \"Gloam Eyed Queen\", before she was defeated by Malekith and the Rune of Death was sealed away (a story is also echoed through Blaidd). That's why when Destined Death is released and we get the Frenzied Flame ending, Melina (Marika) is once again able to channel the power of Destined Death.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMarika created Melina to carry out her final wishes after she was defeated and crucified. Many may say that none of this is conclusive proof because nothing directly states that Melina is Marika, but the amount of things that push the player towards this conclusion is pretty undeniable.",

    "body": "Crazy how Garland made a movie about *the crucible* four years before Elden Ring released. \n\nThe central mystery of the movie is *the shimme*r; an anomaly that manipulates the fabric of life, space and time. There's no antagonist and no clear motive behind this phenomenon, but people who come in contact with this anomaly don't tend to come back. The premise is that nobody has returned in three years of expeditions, and so the story is told through a group of people who, for various reasons, carry some emotional trauma or baggage that quells their fear of not getting out alive. \n\nThe environment of *the shimmer* is an indifferent, rapidly mutating nature that inspires both horror and awe, and the narrative has that slight touch of dream logic and nonlinearity that would feel right at home in an adaptation of a Miyazaki title. Beasts with attributes uncharacteristic of their species, plants shaped like humans, humans with plant features and (minor spoilers) &gt;!a morphing crucible of fire that produces new life from a drop of blood. Very much in line with the way the Crucible/Erdtree is described to process vital energies and produce new life in a perpetual cycle. !&lt;\n\nAlso (final act spoilers) &gt;!a 1v1 between Natalie Portman and a mimic tear.!&lt;\n\n",

My primal glintstone. A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver. someone may come for my life\" - Sellen\n\nWith this we know that the stars control the fate of all Carians, and now that the stars have started moving again Sellen is no longer immortal and Iji himself calls her \"Carian weed\"\n\nI believe that this all is enough evidence to confirm that she is in fact from the Carian family.\n\nbut I'm not convinced, so I went looking for more.\n\nThe first thing to notice is her appearance, fair skin, black hair and blue eyes, very similar to Rennala herself.\n\nShe uses a Carian staff\n\nThe location of the Royal House Scroll is by far the most curious, all the other Scrolls are in Liurnia or Raya Lucaria, which makes perfect sense, but this one in particular, the Carian family Scroll is simply thrown in a random place in Limgrave... near where Sellen is... Oh...\n\nOkay, we have enough evidence to say that she is probably Carian, so the doubts begin, and my speculations about it too\n\nWhy is Sellen frowned upon by the Carians and the Academy? That's quite easy to answer, Sellen herself tells us why, she wants to bring the study of the Primeval Current to the Academy, she doesn't care about the Carians' concerns about these matters, she wants to acquire more knowledge, and if knowledge demands a price then so be it, Sellen's experiments are a means to an end.\n\nAnd why are the Carians against the idea of studying the Primeval Current? There is no answer given by the game, so it depends a lot on your interpretation.\n\nMine is as follows, all those who came into contact with the Primeval Current seem to have seen something terrible that was there, we have something similar happening in the DLC as well with the procession of the stars, Demihuman Onze saw the ruin that awaited him at the end of the procession and he trapped himself.\n\nRennala uses Comet Azur, which makes me think that she also came into contact with the Primeval Current, even if only for a short period of time, and upon seeing what was there, she thought it was better if it were forgotten, so she forbade everyone at the Academy from studying the Primeval Current, and whoever did so would be expelled, which is what happened with Azur and Lusat and also Sellen.\n\nAnd now one of the questions that has been on my mind for a long time, Why doesn't Sellen use us as one of her experiments at any time?\n\nThe answer is quite easy, Sellen considers us as \"Kindred Spirits\", we think the same as her, so to speak, and that's why she has bigger plans for us than simple experiments. But how does she knows that we are like her?\n\nWell... she knows it from her very first line of dialogue.\n\n\"Tarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here\" \n\nWe are Tarnished, the most ambitious being that exists in the Lands Between, the one who uses all possible means to an end, who does not follow rules, we are equal to Sellen in this point, and that is why she treats us differently.\n\nWell that's just my thoughts\n\nThanks for reading",

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "I\u2019ve come across a few posts suggesting that Godwyn might *not* be the son of Godfrey. While I understand why people raise this\u2014Elden Ring does heavily imply that trickery is at play in the lineage of at least one demigod (*cough* Ranni *cough*)\u2014I think it is far more thematic, and narratively satisfying, for Godwyn to truly be Godfrey\u2019s son.\n\nTo see why, it helps to separate the roles of Godfrey and Rennalla from those of Marika and Radagon.\n\n# Vessels vs. Empyreans\n\n* **Godfrey**: Totem of the lion, tied to solar and earthly vitality.\n* **Rennalla**: Totem of the wolf, tied to lunar and watery vitality.\n* **Marika and Radagon**: Empyreans, embodiments of cosmic energy, represented through the Erdtree.\n\nThis sets up a crucial contrast: Godfrey and Rennalla act as *vessels*\u2014earthly conduits of life energy\u2014while Marika and Radagon embody the cosmic.\n\nThe Erdtree itself can \u201creproduce,\u201d but its offspring\u2014like Malenia and Miquella\u2014are not true children. They are closer to asexual clones, reflections of the empyrean rather than hybrids. That\u2019s why Marika *needed* to bear children with Godfrey, and Radagon with Rennalla. The goal was to produce proper heirs: half vessel, half cosmic energy. Children that were whole.\n\nMarika sought a world of vitality and life eternal, without its messy, primal manifestations; horns, blood, and the inevitability of death. She envisioned eternal life without decay. To move toward this, both she and Radagon cast off their aspects of death, hence, Messmer and Melina\u2014and turned to their chosen vessels.\n\nBut there was a flaw in the plan. Children inevitably inherit traits from both parents, including those unwanted elements. Horns from the vessel\u2019s culture, blood from the empyrean\u2019s. Once blessings, these traits became stigmatized as curses under the Erdtree\u2019s doctrine.\n\nThis is where Mohg and Morgott enter the picture. They seem less like intentional \u201cdumping grounds\u201d for these imperfections, and more like tragic byproducts of Marika and Godfrey's attempt at purification.\n\nIn a different age, beings overflowing with vitality (horns) and cosmic blood (rich, radiant energy) might have been celebrated. But in the Age of the Erdtree, such features were condemned as barbaric remnants. Thus, Mohg and Morgott bore the curse of omenborn, symbols of everything the new order rejected.\n\nOnly after this unintended \u201critual\u201d of casting away imperfections could Marika and Godfrey produce Godwyn.\n\nGodwyn embodies the balance they were striving for:\n\n* A vessel imbued with abundant vitality, but free of the horns.\n* Rich with golden cosmic energy, but purified of the \u201ccursed\u201d bloodline marks.\n\nThis makes Godwyn the Golden not just a favored son, but the perfected heir\u2014the culmination of both vessel and empyrean, unmarred by the rejected traits.\n\nThat\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s far more thematic that Godwyn is Godfrey\u2019s son. His very existence embodies the ideals Marika was striving toward: a perfected heir born of both cosmic and vessel, radiant with vitality but stripped of the \u201cimperfections\u201d that doomed his siblings.\n\nThis post does come with several implications. If Godwyn was the solar heir, that would make Ranni, the Lunar heir. It would also explain why, despite Godfrey's proximity to the hornsent culture, he did not have horns, it explained why Marika and Radagon came together and bore Miquella and Malenia, to bear now empyreans, but also to remove rebirth  from the lands between cementing the 'eternal' in the golden order, which would end up haunting their children, for Miquella in the form of nascency and for Malenia in the form of rot. This also may imply that Marika is or was or was supposed to be, the gloam eyed queen, the godess of rot, and the formless mother of blood. ",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n1nzw3",
    "score": 655,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "Hi everyone!\nI\u2019ve been diving into the lore of Messmer and wanted to share a theory that\u2019s been circling in my head and is actually quite famous: Messmer was Marika\u2019s firstborn.\n\nThere are already many posts about Messmer, so my purpose here is to just gather all the information and Lore and expose a couple of theories I have.\n\nI\u2019ll break down the main points with supporting evidence. (I\u2019ll add screenshots for each section under the text)\n\n1. The Statue in Messmer\u2019s Arena\n\nIn Messmer\u2019s boss arena, there\u2019s a statue of Marika holding a baby. To me, it\u2019s obvious that this represents Messmer:\n\nIt\u2019s his arena, so why would she be holding another child there? Even if Marika wasn\u2019t the most affectionate mother, placing a statue of Godwyn or someone else in Messmer\u2019s own chamber makes little sense.\n\nThe depiction of Marika is younger, plain-clothed, and with only one braid, unlike her divine statues elsewhere. This matches a moment after she left the Shaman Village but before her full ascension as a goddess.\n\nOther statues in the Shadow Keep (like the Hippo arena and Church District) show her in the cruciform pose with ornate robes, clearly later in her divine role.\n\nThis makes the arena statue feel like a deliberate reference to Messmer as her first child, during her more \u201chuman\u201d phase.\n\n2. The Omen Curse and the Hornsent\n\nEvery child of Marika (and Radagon, since they are the same being) is cursed in some way:\n\nMalenia \u2192 Scarlet Rot\n\nMiquella \u2192 Eternal Youth\n\nMessmer \u2192 Serpents\n\nThe Omen Twins are cursed as well, but their curse is different. It doesn\u2019t stem from an Outer God, and it has a more \u201cearthly\u201d appearance \u2014 no flames, wings (aside from Mohg's ritual), or cosmic corruption.\n\nMy theory: this curse came from the Hornsent themselves, as retaliation against Marika\u2019s crusade.\n\n&gt; \u201cYou despise us? Then your children will be like us.\u201d\n\nIt would explain why the Omen curse feels so disconnected from the larger Outer God framework, and why it carries the mark of resentment tied to Marika\u2019s war in the Land of Shadow.\n\n3. Godfrey\u2019s Crusade in the Mountaintops\n\nThis part feels like the smoking gun.\n\nIn the Mountaintops of the Giants, we find enormous three-pointed spears stuck in the ground.\n\nTheir design matches Messmer\u2019s spear almost exactly: flame (or branch) -like blade, same guard, same structure.\n\nDuring his fight (and through the Messmer\u2019s Assault Ash of War on his spear), Messmer can replicate his spear infinitely, making many of them come out of the ground, even summoning a new one in his hand after throwing it.\n\nIt\u2019s highly likely he used the same technique against the Giants, leaving behind those massive conjured spears as battle relics \u2014 just like the corpses of the slain Giants.\n\nSo why are they giant-sized? Because big spears for big enemies. It would mean Messmer was directly involved in Godfrey\u2019s conquest of the Giants, participating as Marika\u2019s firstborn warrior. Perhaps the strongest too?\n\n4. The White Serpents\n\nAfter Messmer's second phase transition, his serpents turn pale/ashen. To me, this symbolizes a change in him \u2014 a state that visually connects him more with his sister Malenia\u2019s rotten wings than with Radagon himself.\n\nHis connection to Radagon, instead, comes from:\n\nSharing Marika\u2019s blood (and thus Radagon\u2019s),\n\nHis red hair,\n\nThe heavy similarity between his boss theme and Radagon\u2019s, with Messmer\u2019s sounding like a \u201ccursed\u201d version.\n\nThis reinforces the idea that he was always part of the family line shaped by Radagon\u2019s latent presence within Marika.\n\n5. Radagon as a Latent Curse\n\nRadagon only appeared publicly during the Liurnian Wars, but that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t exist before. What if he was a latent curse within Marika that later manifested as a separate being?\n\nHe literally \u201cchanges\u201d Marika\u2019s form, passing from a \"small\" blonde woman to a tall and strong redhead man.\n\nThis would explain why so many of their children carry strange, curse-like traits.\n\nMessmer\u2019s red hair could be proof that Radagon\u2019s influence was already present inside Marika long before he was fully revealed.\n\nEven the music connection (Messmer\u2019s theme echoing Radagon\u2019s) feels like deliberate reinforcement of this link.\n\nConclusion\n\nTaken together:\n\nThe unique statue,\n\nThe nature of the Omen curse,\n\nThe Mountaintop spears,\n\nMessmer\u2019s serpents and red hair,\n\nRadagon\u2019s hidden role\u2026\n\nAll point toward one thing: Messmer was Marika\u2019s firstborn demigod.\n\nWhat do you think? Does the evidence fit, or am I missing something? I\u2019d love to hear other interpretations. Please keep it respectful \u2014 this is all theorycrafting.",

The other two - a dagger and greatsword - are stabbed into him, used to restrain his free hands. I believe that the dagger comes from Dutchess, and the greatsword comes from Wylder, arguably the two main story characters and the two who specialize in those weapon classes. They impaled him with these weapons on a previous run.\n\nBut this is a 3 player game, so who was their third? Recluse. (The rags around the Shape of Night's body bear the mark of Recluse's sealing stone.)[https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/s/LaD7Fyi8W0]\n\nOk, so Dutchess, Wylder, and Recluse fought and sealed the Night before - how is that possible, why wouldn't they remember? Well, the game starts with Wylder having amnesia, and Dutchess explains that Wylder has actually fought with them many times before the tutorial, but sometimes the Night takes its toll on them and their memories get erased. And if this had all happened before and they simply forgot, it would explain how the Iron Menial knew about Recluse's seal on the Shape of Night. Per the Vesitge of Night item:\n\n&gt;Burned and worn down over a span of time untold, the hint of an impression once made by the engraving of an old sealing stone can be seen, but it is no longer legible.  The menial asked about an engraving. But how did he know there was one, before setting eyes upon it?\n\nHe knew because he's the only one of this group who can actually retain his memories of what happened before, because he doesn't venture into the Night like they do.\n\nOkay, but if they defeated Heolstor before, why is the Night still an issue? Well, both Wylder and Ironeye's endings lead us to believe that the Night can survive beyond Heolstor. Wylder's basically explicitly tells us it's a cycle. It's likely his sealing postponed, but did not eradicate, the coming Night.\n\nI also don't think it's a coincidence that the three hinted at here (Wylder, Dutchess, and Recluse) are the same three hinted at by the gravestones in the Roundtable crypt. Perhaps it was those three who \"elected to become the foundation\" of the Nightfarers/Hold by being the first to take on Heolstor.",

This makes the Beastmen quite tragic as they were brought into existence only to blindly serve.\n\n*Having gained intelligence, the beasts must have felt how*\u00a0***their wildness slipped away***\u00a0*as civilization took hold.*\n\n*The beastmen have always fired earthenware jars for the express purpose of making shields.*  \n***Such are their ways, strange though they are.***\n\n*Weapon in the form of a carnivorous beast's vicious claws.

The Overview trailer of Nightreign said the following:\n\n\"Once a country that thrived thanks to the power of Gods, Limveld is now nearing its end, gradually being eroded by the Night that has saturated the land\"\n\nThat first line referring the Gods and a clear shot depicting the titanic shades over the horizon confirms it. The Old Gods are the titanic giants that once lived on the Lands Between, whose skulls now rot over the passage of time. Beings capable of so much power, that existed (at least in my head and based on what I know) as the first beings inhabitating that world. Long before the Beastmen, The Rauh...but a country, Limveld, existed thanks to them.\n\nHow? What is Limveld? What is the Night? Which are the Wayfarers' stories? What are the Nightlords?\n\nWhatever the case, this game is gonna teach us so much about the base game. Give us new lines of speculation, at the bare minimum. Even the game is not canon, with all the Souls bosses and the randomized enemies, they are using a set and a canon timeline as base for the game. \n\nHype is up.",

    "body": "Hey all.\n\n\nI think this has merit! I know it\u2019s HUGE, but please, I beg you, take a look!\n\n##- Structure:\n\n 1. **Preamble.**\n 2. **Marika's actions.**\n 3. **Radagon.**\n 4. **The turning point.**\n 5. **The Shattering.**\n 6. **Miquella addendum.**\n\n\n\nAfter playing through SotE (late, I know), I\u2019ve spent the entire past week trying to piece together everything concerning Marika (and Radagon), whom I consider a fantastic character. But then I\u2019ve been looking at threads about her and, to my surprise, I see her most often dismissed as an uncaring monster. I think that completely misses the point of the character (and, by extension, of the entire game, since she\u2019s basically a protagonist in absentia). So I\u2019m going to give my take and, hopefully, someone will like it.\n\n\n**TLDR:** Marika is not innocent by any means, but the entire game happens because she isn\u2019t a monster, either. She is someone that really, really wanted to do kindness, but ended up doing terrible things for what she legitimately thought was the greater good. And then, she realizes that it has to stop, and when she can't, she literally sacrifices herself so that someone else can fix it in the future. The game gives us plenty of hints, which I\u2019ll look into in this, admittedly, enormous post.\n\n\n#- Preamble.\n\nContext is everything. To understand Marika, you need to consider her context, not judge her (terrible) actions in a vacuum. And what\u2019s her context? Duty (or \u201cfaith\u201d \u2013 I\u2019ll get to that later) versus morality. That\u2019s her entire arc.\n\n\n###From her Soreseal:\n\n***\"Solemn duty weighs upon the one beholden; not unlike a gnawing curse from which there is no deliverance.\"***\n\n\nA solemn duty that gnaws, and cannot be cast aside.\n\nMarika is an immortal queen. Her duty is to keep the stability and prosperity of her kingdom, **first and foremost**, forever. This is above everything \u2013 even family, and even her morality. After all, that\u2019s exactly what a ruler is supposed to do: the national interest comes first, and personal matters last.\n\n All the terrible things that she does? **It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t care; it\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t matter if she cares** - she has to do what she has to do. And it weighs on her, more and more.\n\nWe also know, because Ymir tells us unambiguously, that Marika is under guidance from the Two Fingers \u2013 who, she thinks, represent the Greater Will. The faith of the Greater Will revolves around the Erdtree, which is the center of Marika\u2019s kingdom. And so, her duty and her faith are entirely intertwined.\n\n**This premise is essential and needs to be kept in mind for everything that follows.**\n\n\n#- The (horrible) things that she does.\n\n###From a Finger reader crone:###\n\n***\"Wherever the path leads, so shall you follow. Wherever the path leads, only more sorrow. T'is a curse! A curse! The curse of Queen Marika.\"***\n\nIn other words: whatever duty (or faith) requires, she will do. And with everything she does, only more sorrow comes. For others, of course, but also for herself \u2013 otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be a curse for her.\n\n- **The fire giants?** Their Cursed Flame is an existential threat to the Erdtree \u2013 of course she would have to destroy them. *But it\u2019s awful, and she knows.*\n- **Her omen kids?** She passes a law forbidding their horns from being cut \u2013 clearly hinting that she did love them to some measure. But think of this from within their society\u2019s perspective: how could the children of the Goddess, be two hated accursed? It would tear their people\u2019s faith apart! Of course they had to be locked away! *Yet, again, it\u2019s awful. And I\u2019d wager it is at this point that Marika, for the first time, starts having doubts about it all.*\n- **Sending Godfrey away?** Someone needs to prepare future Elden Lords, and who better than the very first Elden Lord, a man that she knows, trusts, and quite possibly loves? *It makes sense, pragmatically \u2013 but there goes her husband.*\n- **Sealing Messmer away?** Marika made special, powerful physicks just for him and only for him, according to the item description of the Blessing of Marika; clearly suggesting that she did care. But Messmer has a destructive entity sealed inside, that even Marika fears. How can you have such a thing wandering the kingdom, and potentially exploding at any time? Of course she has to seal him away. *But now, she\u2019s losing yet another child.*\n- **The wandering merchants?** Willingly or not, they carry omens of the Frenzied Flame, the most destructive force known in Elden ring \u2013 of course she has to lock them away. *And yet, once more, it\u2019s atrocious, and she knows.*\n\nAnd then come the Liurnian wars. I don\u2019t even know why she was attacking these people, and I suspect she really didn\u2019t, either \u2013 most likely it was because the Fingers said so. This is when it became too much... **and this is also when we first hear of Radagon.**\n\n\n\n#- So who is Radagon?\n\nRadagon is Marika\u2019s *\u201cblind belief.\u201d* She tells us herself:\n\n***\"I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.\u00a0Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.\u00a0Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past.\u00a0My comrades; why must ye falter?\"***\n\n**The days of blind belief are past**, because she has literally, physically, cast her blind belief aside, in the form of Radagon, a known Golden Order fundamentalist.\n\n**The bliss, the blissful days**, are gone because, having cast her blind belief aside, Marika now knows, without any doubt, that the things she\u2019s been doing are not justified, and things need to change.\n\nSo, *Marika and Radagon are \u201cthe same person\u201d, but this is actually misleading*, even if true in a way.\n\nRadagon is an aspect of Marika\u2019s personality that she cast aside, into a new body. *But, from this point forward, they are also completely different individuals. And they despise each other*, because their ideologies are in direct conflict \u2013 **Marika wants kindness, and Radagon wants order, whatever the cost**. And later on, as we know, Marika will shatter the Ring, while Radagon will try to repair it.\n\n\nTo use a well known analogy (please don\u2019t downvote me for it), it\u2019s really a \u201cKami and Piccolo\u201d situation. Except we can deduce that if the \u201clesser\u201d part dies (Radagon / Trina), the \u201cmain\u201d one (Marika / Miquella) doesn\u2019t. Because if they did, then Trina could have simply killed herself instead of asking us to deal with Miquella.\n\nI theorize that Radagon marries Rennala as part of an agreement between Marika and Radagon. Marika doesn\u2019t want another tragedy, but Radagon wants to do as the faith demands. Turning the Liurnians into allies via marriage solves the problem, while satisfying both points of view.\n\n\n\n#- What happens then?\n\nThe previous quote is relevant again:\n\n***\"I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.\u00a0Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.\u00a0Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past.\u00a0My comrades; why must ye falter?\"***\n\nNow, the Two Fingers, and Radagon (since he wants no change), and the Golden Order (if anyone in it knew what was really going on, or if they simply were fanatical enough), have a problem: the Goddess herself is doubting them, and she is going to investigate. The Fingers know that, given time, she will learn what\u2019s up. And Radagon, being a fanatic, doesn\u2019t want anything to change.\n\nIt is very interesting to note, from the quote, that *\u201cher comrades falter.\u201d* This suggests that Marika\u2019s word within the Order was NOT absolute. If it was, no one would falter \u2013 her word would be law.\n\nAnyway \u2013 the solution they find is to *replace Marika, with Radagon*. This is why, first, he becomes her new consort.\n\n***\"O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.\u00a0Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.\u00a0Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.\"***\n\n*And then, somehow, a re-merge is forced upon Marika*. I do not know how; perhaps it had to do with Radagon\u2019s Law of regression, or perhaps the Fingers coerced her into it, or perhaps it was some sort of political decision appealing to Marika\u2019s queenly duty.\n\nBut the exact method doesn\u2019t matter very much, I think. What matters is that *it was definitely non-consensual*, and that they didn\u2019t just re-merge:\n\n***\"Thou'rt yet to become me.\"***\n\nThis suggests that *Radagon is trying to take over. And the \u201cyet\u201d suggests he\u2019s making progress*. A pretty fucked up situation for Marika, if you ask me.\n\n\n\n#- The Shattering:\n\nWe know that Marika shatters the Elden Ring *\u201csome time\u201d* after Godwyn\u2019s assassination. This suggests *it wasn\u2019t a knee-jerk, emotionally driven reaction*, not quite \u2013 because then it would have been immediate. But Godwyn\u2019s death is the last straw. It\u2019s been too much sorrow, too many tragedies piled upon each other.\n\nI believe at this point, Marika, in despair, investigates. And she learns what\u2019s really going on. *That the Greater Will has never been there. That she\u2019s been lied to her whole life. That every atrocity she has commited, every sacrifice she\u2019s made, has been for an entirely false premise. Her kingdom isn\u2019t the paradise she had hoped for, and her personal life is a nightmare. And now, they\u2019re looking to functionally erase her, replace her with Radagon, and keep the lie going*. At this point, it\u2019s exactly as Ymir tells us:\n\n***\"No matter our efforts, if the roots are rotten, then we have little recourse.\"***\n\nAnd this is also relevant again:\n\n***\"O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.\u00a0Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.\u00a0Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.\"***\n\nMarika realizes that the whole system is rotten, and also seems to think she doesn\u2019t have much time left: *Thou'rt yet to become me. Let us be shattered, both*: meaning, **\u201cYou are taking over me, but you are not quite there yet, and I\u2019ll shatter myself and take you with me before you make it.\u201d**. This must be from just before the Shattering.\n\nAnd in that case, then **the only thing she can do to START trying to fix the system, is to dismantle it entirely, and hope that someone else, in the future, will do what she couldn\u2019t**.\n\nI often see people saying Marika was looking only to keep her power, but this doesn\u2019t make sense. If she was, then she wouldn\u2019t have started questioning anything. She would have rolled with it, and kept her power! As a \u201cpuppet to the Great Will\u201d, yes, but come on \u2013 she had immortality, eternal youth, godlike power. Why would anyone crave more?\n\n\n###To the demigods, she says:###\n\n***\"Hear me, Demigods. My children beloved.\u00a0Make of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord.\u00a0Be it a God.\u00a0But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.\u00a0Amounting only to sacrifices... \"***\n\nShe is, literally, telling them the plot of the game! They must either become Gods of a new era (like Miquella is doing), or Elden Lords of a new, hopefully better cycle of the existing era (like Godfrey is doing). And if they don\u2019t, *then they\u2019ll be slain by whomever does it \u2013 which ends up being the player*, in this case. \u201cSacrificed\u201d to the player (or to whomever else it might have been), to make him more powerful.\n\n*She isn\u2019t saying this because she\u2019s evil. She\u2019s saying it because that is how their world works.*\n\n\n\n#- The Shaman Village:\n\nThis is what kickstarted my entire post, but it has nothing to do with the massacre, nor with the Hornsent. Not directly. I think the most relevant piece of information in the village is the Minor Erdtree incantation:\n\n***\"Secret incantation of Queen Marika.\nOnly the kindness of gold, without Order. \"***\n\nThis, I think, is a message as straightforward as we can ever get in a Fromsoft game:\n\n**Only the kindness of gold (Marika), without Order (Radagon)**. Who are both the same, but also not really!\n\nWhen Marika is mourning her village, in that moment, she\u2019s not a queen, nor a goddess \u2013 she\u2019s only a person. And in that moment, with no external pressure, no duty to uphold, she is as she really wishes to be: a kind person that wants to heal others, nothing more.\n\nThere are other hints towards this: \n\n- the way Ranni, in her ending, picks Marika\u2019s head in an expressly **very, very gentle manner, suggesting fondness** in spite of all.\n- the fact that Godfrey returns to her when called, and the cut lines that outright state how he still loves her (naturally, take cut content as you will. But I think they were cut simply because they were too straightforward, and we know well that Miyazaki generally avoids that.)\n\n\t*Remember that, while Marika is enigmatic for us, Ranni and Godfrey would have known her well.*\n- the way she \u201cscreams\u201d in the FF ending. **Not because she\u2019s fully dying, but because the world is dying**. Marika fully dies in Ranni\u2019s ending as well, but there the visual is completely different \u2013 she appears at peace, because the world will go on, which is what she wanted.\n- the symbolism of her being literally broken, suggesting\u2026 well, a broken person. Not an evil monster. *An evil monster wouldn\u2019t have broken from all the atrocities: it wouldn\u2019t have cared!*\n\n\nAll in all, I think From and GRRM are trying to tell us that Marika is **not to be interpreted as some cold, uncaring monster** \u2013 she is a deeply tragic figure, victim and unwitting villain simultaneously, torn between her duty and her sense of right and wrong. She spent her entire existence really, really wishing to do goodness, only to realize, too late, that her entire system had been built upon a false foundation, and that all the tragedies had been for nothing. And in the end, having no way to fix it, she sacrificed herself, to try and make it possible for someone else to fix it in the future.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of whether or not she may still be alive, let alone restorable, let alone whether she\u2019d want to keep living, by the end of the game. But that, I think, has been intentionally left in the air, and there\u2019s little point to trying to find definitive answer.\n\nThat\u2019s my take on her. But I\u2019m not yet done!\n\n\n\n\n#- About Miquella:\n\nMiquella realizes, at least, some of these things. He knows that his mother\u2019s undoing, in the end, was her conscience \u2013 and one's conscience, fundamentally, emanates from one's ability to love. That\u2019s what her actions to gnaw at her. In a pragmatic way, that\u2019s why everything spiraled down.\n\nSo, Miquella discards his love before ascending. Because if he cannot feel love, then he will act pragmatically as needed. *He will be able to do whatever it takes, forever, because he will not have a conscience wearing him down.*\n\nBut, of course, a leader devoid of love would also be terrifying \u2013 and a lot worse than Marika ever was.\n\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s all! Long, I know, but I think it has merit. What do you think? ",

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "I was doing some lore searching last night (technically this morning, I think it was 3 AM or something before I passed out) and I was examining Rennala\u2019s feet with the looking glass (for lore purposes) and had a revelation:\nFingers are an important symbol in Elden Ring\u2019s cosmology, and despite being completely unexplored within the game\u2019s explicitly stated lore, bare feet are JUST as prevalent symbolism. \n\nWhat\u2019s more, I\u2019ve noticed a pattern to where bare feet appear. Every instance I could find of this symbolism is associated with characters who are in some way outcasts from the golden order (by extension, the greater will and the fingers). \nRennala and the Carian Royalty, the Albinaurics, Sellen (representative of the Glintstone sorcerers), Fia (representative of those who live in death), Miquella (who abandoned the golden order), Malenia (vessel for the outer god of rot), Morgott (Omen), The pickled fowl feet (birds).\n\nAnd most important piece of evidence: the fire giant, who invokes the power of the fell god by offering his foot.\nWhat\u2019s important about the connection to the fell god is that it\u2019s symbolised by circles (or rings). More specifically: a ring of fire. \nAs some have pointed out, the ring of fire has an uncanny resemblance to the dark sign (a prominent symbol in the dark souls trilogy), which ALSO prominently displays feet as symbolism (whereas fingers are rarely ever brought up). \n\nYou might argue that this is coincidence. But I think it\u2019s far more likely that this additionally reinforces the theory that Elden Ring and Dark Souls share a deeper, more direct connection. \n\nWith this perfect bridge between the two series established, it also neatly lays the groundwork for Nightreign (a much more explicit, 100% canon continuation of the lore). Since the fingers are considered envoys of the greater will, it\u2019s only natural that feet symbolise an equivalent outer god of equal significance, which I predict will have a strong presence in Nightreign. Presently, it makes sense that this outer god and its envoys have a greatly reduced presence compared to the fingers due to the similarity between how fingers and toes are presented in both Japanese, AND biblical mythology (of which, Elden ring is based) in which fingers are openly displayed very commonly, and yet toes are usually covered by one\u2019s shoes (thus, concealed from view). \n\nMost likely, this outer god is the fell god, considering the aforementioned phase transition in the fire giant fight, and two simultaneous threads bridging Elden Ring and Dark Souls. But I\u2019m interested to hear what you all think. Just speculation, but I think this is pretty convincing evidence for the fell god to make an appearance in Nightreign, and for toes/feet to have a much greater presence in future titles. ",

Then that would\u2019ve made the merge possible. So I think it\u2019s most likely a character we either don\u2019t know or do and just haven\u2019t made the connection yet.\n\nBut in any case, I think it\u2019s clear that Marika BROKE OUT of the goop bag/swaddling cloth meant to fuse her and her partner into sainthood or godhood. That\u2019s why she\u2019s naked when she takes the Elden goop to the divine gate.  The rags she wears are the leftover pieces of the bag she was stuffed into. This is also why Marika is so shiny and sticky.\n\nThat OR the naked Marika is the finished product and the corpses inside the goop bag? But I think it\u2019s more likely Marika escaped and possibly killed the person inside with her. That would be the betrayal. This is head canon: but maybe she had begun merging, stopped, which didn\u2019t kill her since she was a shaman, but killed the guy cuz he was a Hornsent. She freed herself, stole the Elden Ring goop that had been formed, and forced the Elden Ring into her.\n\nThat\u2019s why she\u2019s almost naked.\n\nI think that white ball in the goop sack is most likely the head of the other person, hence the big sphere shape.

Anyways, I noticed that this tree (while being completely spectral) is grown around a divine tower.

In the distance, far past the final boss\u2019s gate, there is another spectral tree though different from the one in the picture and possibly not even a tree at all. \n\nI am very interested to see if they elaborate on any of this when the full game releases. Will we get a name for the tree/tower? While I\u2019m somewhat doubtful that we will get any new details in text or dialogue, I am interested whether we may be able to glean anything from the environment and world. If anything, I feel we might learn more about the trees and hopefully why Nightreign seems to be so strange in comparison to the base game.

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "At first glance, the snake skin in Bonny Village might not seem remarkable. However, viewing it from a planimetric perspective starts to reveal intriguing details (see fig.1). The real surprise comes when you rotate the image (see fig.2), and flipping it completely takes the discovery to another level ((see fig.3).\n\nThe flipped and rotated snake skin immediately brought to mind a pattern I had seen throughout the Lands Between\u2014none other than the design behind Marika's statues scattered across the base game. Initially unsure, I decided to do a side-by-side comparison of the snake skin and the pattern behind Marika's statue. The results were astonishing! Both featured similar circular patterns, the tail, and even the positioning of the heads of Marika and the snake skin were identical (see fig.1*). This revelation compelled me to delve deeper into the mystery, beginning with the large snake skin in the Temple of Eiglay.\n\nOnce again, the snake skin in the Temple of Eiglay brought to mind Marika's statues. The way her arms are outstretched bears a striking resemblance to how the snake skin has been meticulously stretched out (see fig.4).\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the Black Flame, a power wielded by the Gloam-eyed Queen in Elden Ring, which she used to bring about the downfall of gods. If the Gloam-eyed Queen drew on the Elden Ring to enhance her Black Flame, it\u2019s plausible that the Rune of Death played a key role in amplifying its destructive power. Maliketh, Marika\u2019s shadow beast, defeated the Gloam-eyed Queen and sealed the Rune of Death, from which Ranni later extracted a fragment to forge the blade responsible for Godwyn\u2019s demise.\n\nDuring the fight against Maliketh in Farum Azula, he eventually unleashes the power of Destined Death, which is tied to the Black Flame, channeling it into his sword. This transforms his blade into a Godslaying weapon, capable of diminishing HP over time\u2014essentially creating another Godslaying Sword. But there\u2019s more to uncover. A closer inspection of Maliketh\u2019s Blackblade reveals a curious detail: one side of the guard is broken (see fig.5). Now, let\u2019s juxtapose this with an endgame scene where the player character confronts Marika\u2019s decapitated statue (see fig. 6). Notice how Marika\u2019s single remaining hand mimics the shape of a sword guard. Additionally, her lower half is cloaked in black fabric. Considering Marika\u2019s fractured form, it feels as though she mirrors the very essence of Maliketh\u2019s Blackblade (see fig.7).\n\nCould all this evidence suggest that Marika was once the Gloam-eyed Queen or perhaps shared some connection with her? In my recent video, I explore two intriguing theories that could explain the evidence I\u2019ve presented so far\u2014and much more. You can watch it here: https://youtu.be/9H2hvrVwRkQ. Thank you.",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpmfba",
    "score": 821,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "(I posted this in the main subreddit but decided to share it here as well, since the last Bayle post inspired me to write it up. Apologies if you've already seen it :) I really hope to open a discussion about this. I wonder if there's things in the game that go against this theory. And please let me know if you also know of more things that might support this idea!)\n\nThe first time I played the DLC i was convinced Bayle used to be human and transcended to dragon. Here is my reasoning:\n\n**1. Bayle doesn't look typical.**\u00a0There's the two types of dragons we see in the game: Ancient dragons which have more than 2 wings that are separate from their arms, and Drakes, which are more like wyverns since they only have 2 whings which are in place of their arms. Bayle technically has two wings, but has neither feathers nor stone-like scales, like the dragons we've seen so far. To me it seems like he has very thick rough skin with spikes, kind of like the skin of the wyrms! If you take a look at Bayle in the second stage (Image 2), he will \"conjure\" his wings. Which are exactly the way that the wyrm wings are - he has four limbs and a separate set of two wings. And additionally, his wings reassemble the wings that wyrms have, having a similar shape, skin and claws on them. (Image 3).\n\nThe way he he conjures his wings reminds me of the way drake warriors and people who participate in the communion aquire dragon abilities and conjure parts of dragons as incantations.\n\n2.\u00a0**The communion thinks that he is the most powerful and oldest dragon of all**, but they could be just speculating and worshipping him because nobody has managed to beat him before. Additionally, history and time might have deluted the truth. Perhaps at first, the dragon communion was very aware of what Bayle was and perhaps envied/respected him as a powerful drake warrior. But maybe over the years, the communion started to \"forget\" why exactly they praise him so much, maybe the ones who knew him before he started turning to a dragon died, and instead the communion started to worship him and just see him as a powerful dragon, the most ambitious target for a drake knight. At some point the priestess talks about Igon: \"*The mad hunger and fierceness of spirit that only flows from those young and short of sight. He rather reminds me of Bayle, in fact. Such thoughts are unfathomable to ones as old as we.*\" These words not only compare Bayle to the character of a drake warrior, but also, to me, they hint at the idea that a lot of time has passed and people now, including her, are too young to comprehend or see what really happened in the past and who Bayle was.\n\n3.\u00a0**Just like the drake knights that try to hunt him to consume his heart,**\u00a0Bayle ambitiously went after Placidusax, a type of ancient dragon, not a drake. There are theories about how ancient dragons can perhaps manipulate time and space, so i think he was kind of in over his head when he did that, hence why he didn't defeat them and only injured them. He didnt get the heart, but instead two of their heads, which perhaps gave him SOME powers (like for example the red-ish lightning that he uses in addition to flame).\n\nHis powers were perhaps mainly flame/magma, like the wyrms, but after trying to consume Placidusax, he obtained some of their lightning and laser beams, and that is why now his powers are a combo of both.\n\n**So to summarize**: Bayle has an unusual body, unlike any other dragon that we know, with rough skin and wings, which are similar to a wyrms, conjured in the same manner as dragon communion incantations. He is the most prolific drake knight ever, the first to \"successfully\" turn into a dragon, was the first to go after an ancient dragon and barely survived it, then retreated to a safer place at the peak, because not only was he injured but other drakes were after him, because he was allegedly the most powerful dragon they could hunt.\n\nAnd that's it!",

However, after reflecting on it, I realized it was missing crucial evidence and contained too much unnecessary speculation. This post is a heavily expanded and refined version, with significantly more supporting evidence and deeper analysis. While some parts are carried over from my previous post as a foundation, I have greatly expanded on the logic to clarify key points, introduced new evidence that was previously overlooked, and addressed additional counterarguments to strengthen the case.\n\nLet\u2019s first establish a general timeline of the events that are going to be relevant-\n\nWe know from gaius\u2019s remembrance and Rellana\u2019s lore that Messmer\u2019s crusade must have begun sometime after 2^(nd) Liurnian wars. The crusade must have begun before Radagon became elden lord as he removed all colosseum practices in his era as per the ritual sword talisman description and in the lands of shadow we find the dueling shield which says that these practices somehow remained in the shadow realm.\n\nNow, whether the crusade began before or after Godfrey\u2019s banishment is unclear. Many claim that Messmer knows what a tarnished is so the crusade must have begun after his banishment and Marika abandoned him right then and there due to fear. This is based on Messmer\u2019s remembrance, however that is mistranslated. A video from Last Protagonist explains what the original description is saying. I had a few problems with getting an approval for this post so I will provide the link in a comment or if someone requests it.\n\nIn the original Japanese it reads \u2018A wicked snake writhed within Messmer. His mother replaced his eye with a sealing grace. Yet nevertheless hid him within shadow.\u2019 If someone who knows Japanese well, is reading this post, do talk about whether this is accurate or not as this is the only source of the original description that I could find. The wording heavily affects the implications of the description so please confirm the accuracy here.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the new description. \u2018Yet nevertheless\u2019 emphasizes a contradiction Marika tried to contain the serpent by sealing his eye, but that alone wasn\u2019t enough. This suggests something happened that made her take an extra step. Unlike the English version there is no mention of fear here. The wording simply explains a contrast but not an urgency of any kind. Hence it is unlikely that Marika planned to use the crusade as a front to seal Messmer away. I do not know anyone who can explain the language of Japanese so anyone fluent in Japanese please do confirm the accuracy.\n\nNow if you want to argue, \u2018The wording in the original implies that she felt the sealing was not enough so she sealed him away\u2019 then here is my counter to that- \\*\\*\"\\*\\*She Felt Sealing His Eye Was Not Enough\" is an Assumption. The text does not state or imply that she believed sealing his eye was insufficient. Instead, it simply states that *despite sealing his eye, she hid him away* which leaves open the possibility that this decision came much later.\n\nAll this leaves the motives very vague. Since the motives are left vague so is the placement of Messmer\u2019s sealing because if fear was the motive, then that would confirm that she would have sealed him the first opportunity she got but the original Japanese says nothing about fear. This description was the one thing that I completely forgot to explain in my original post so all this should refute it effectively.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow there is a bunch of evidence that suggests Messmer returned to Leyndell-\n\n\u00a0\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Black Knight Andreas spirit ash-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggv13qrkriie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9013d9bc2d75444ddc97fc1d7ef6e58154c20e7a\n\nFocus on the line I have underlined, \u2018flight from the Erdtree\u2019. This description is saying that Messmer was chased away from his home (If you read this as being Andreas\u2019 flight then the third point addresses it).\n\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The flight being the beginning of the crusade is not possible as it was commemorated which means that the crusade had the support of the erdtree at its beginning. If the crusade was supported, Messmer must also have had the support of the erdtree hence he would not be chased away-\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\"A finely-made \"redshield\" featuring an engraving of a winged serpent. Excels at guarding against fire. Said to have been made to commemorate the beginnings of the crusade started by Messmer, son of Marika\"*\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis specifically says \u2018beginnings.\u2019 Commemorations are typically reserved for events seen as meaningful or honorable at the time. If a shield was made specifically to commemorate the crusade\u2019s beginnings, it suggests that the crusade must have had a considerable amount of support at least in the beginnings. The fact that the shield is *finely made* suggests that effort, skill and resources were invested in it which would only happen if it had a considerable amount of support. If the shield was a **trap**, it would not be described as made to commemorate the beginnings of the crusade, there would be somewhat of a hint in the wording to suggest that it was a trap but it does not. The wording implies that at the start of the crusade, there was real support, not an immediate attempt to betray him. Nothing in the wording of this description suggests foul play. The Fire Knights, who came from noble families, joined Messmer at the start of the crusade and only later were scorned (I will get into this with my 3^(rd) point) . This suggests there was initial public backing for Messmer, meaning the shield was likely created during the period when he was still seen favorably and not an enemy. All this means that the flight must have happened after a period of time since the crusade began.\n\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fire knight helm description -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01p3f5foriie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed65081e91b9522e643f00d903dd95e75140e998\n\nThe fire knights were chased due to their loyalty to Messmer. This would only happen if Messmer was suddenly hated for some reason. This confirms that Messmer was scorned. If you read Andreas\u2019 description as being his flight instead of Messmer\u2019s then this description would go against that. Even if it is andreas\u2019 flight, Messmer logically must have been scorned first for him to be chased away. The phrase \"after pledging allegiance\" suggests that their exile happened as a consequence of their decision, not immediately upon Messmer starting the crusade. If they were instantly hated, the description would say something like \"as soon as the crusade began, they were shunned\" instead of tying their exile specifically to the moment of allegiance. It is also possible that these guys publicly pledged allegiance to Messmer after he was scorned so you can take that explaination as well. Messmer\u2019s scorning must have happened a period of time after the crusade began as the serpent crest shield implies that Messmer had the erdtree\u2019s support at the start. He must have been looked at favorably for the fire knights to have initially joined him. All this means Messmer must have returned from the crusade at least once (though I would argue multiple times due to the next point).\n\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To further solidify this, the stone tablets at the specimen storehouse and the queen\u2019s bedchambers are the exact same-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8o2ulaxpriie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=780ccf9cdb890212d91a5e1857aad979eb91fc00\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lp1rh4xqriie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f19213920cc2099b4c7642ba9c9658190176c476\n\nThis is not a case of reused assets because these tablets are found nowhere else in the base game to my knowledge. Messmer likely brought these to Marika by himself. Due to the sheer number of tablets here, I would say it is likely that Messmer had to return multiple times. This also goes against the assumption that Marika wanted Messmer to be forgotten, since if she really did want that, she would have destroyed those stone tablets as well. Also, the impaler\u2019s catacomb in weeping peninsula still manages to exist. That is near a castle under the rule of the golden order so her forgetting this makes no sense-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzqnywnuriie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e77cce56fb20667f56398db4444dbf1d3621ccd\n\n\u00a0Hence, it\u2019s unlikely that Marika tried to remove him from history. Why does Marika want those tablets? Well, the answer doesn\u2019t really matter but my personal headcannon is that Messmer found out that the jar innards are still alive and he told Marika so she started doing research in an attempt to cure them but it seems she was unsuccessful. Anyhow, what matters is that Messmer did return to her.\n\nHere is how the timeline looks like now-\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7uaoctvriie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d9461517380d9da35dac9dfa4e23dfa2087133\n\nSo now we know that the crusade must have started around the time Godfrey was banished but we still don\u2019t know when Messmer was sealed in the lands of shadow. \u00a0There are 2 obscure details that gives us a big hint-\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sentry torch held by the tree sentinels outside shaman village-\n\nHere is a pic of the tree sentinel in questions-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0odsom5xriie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febd6ad311f5c37dc0c2d256ce61eeaf7a446c2a\n\nTake a close look at that torch-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pb02vn9yriie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65c2d037b9e63be3949452ffbb1b99035f1c3809\n\nHere is the player holding the sentry torch-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ep6ft08zriie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973256f635c99611a12b5958c36cbeee4283cae6\n\nHere is a pic from the wiki-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikpkcc62siie1.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=314e9af267d5ceb826f51aa072f1c2f754b0839a\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much the same model(minus the size difference but that also happens with boss weapons so video game logic lol). Therefore, the tree sentinel is holding the sentry torch. Here is what the sentry torch description says-\n\n*\"Torch Given to protectors of the Erdtree. Its flames are bestowed with a special incantation which allows the bearer to see assassins cloaked in veils. Furnished on behalf of the Erdtree and the Grace-Given Lord such that a Night of Black Knives will never come again.\"*\n\nThis description confirms that this torch was made after the night of the black knives as before that event, the black knives were not a thing. Which means this tree sentinel must have arrived here after that night. This means that Messmer was sealed after Godwyn\u2019s death. If this was just a mere reuse then they simply could have put two tree sentinels with a shield instead of giving one a torch but they did not do that hence there must be a lore reason for it. No other torch is said to have been used by the knights of the erdtree so no argument to be found there.\n\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Death Knights are (likely) not actually dead-\n\nMost assume that the death knights are actually dead and that is how they got into the shadow realm which is a reasonable assumption. But there are a few things people miss which suggest that the death knights might not actually be dead-\n\nThis is a CORPSE of a death knight-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14xucd55siie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb78173a46c9919b38a3ec1b6fa652afb5073eb0\n\nIf he really did die to get to become a death knight and go to the shadow realm then may I ask why did he turn into a corpse instead of disintegrating? The enemies that are \u2018dead\u2019 like spirits, those who live in death, etc all disintegrate when they die but this guy turned into a corpse? Also I am pretty sure there is no corpse in the game of a character that had already died. By that I mean we only see the corpses of those who went from living to dead but never of one from dead to deader (don\u2019t really know which term would fit here). Hence, it\u2019s likely that these death knights are not actually dead. Something many miss about the death knights is that the last rites ash of war\u2019s effect (sacred order too I am pretty sure) that makes us do 2x damage against \u2018those who live in death\u2019 does not apply to them (they do not receive 2x damage). I used the golden arcs incantation with min stat req and a plus 0 finger seal around blessing level 10 I don\u2019t remember exactly, before the buff the incantation did a max of 126 damage and after the buff it did 138 damage max which I am pretty sure is the +25 holy damage that the buff adds which means the game does not count these guys as a part of those who live in death and hence are not \u2018dead\u2019 necessarily. This would make it unlikely that the death knights got into the LOS through some death connections. Other death based minibosses like ghostflame dragon, death rite birds, etc are all affected by this buff hence it\u2019s not really a miniboss thing (though in my testing the 2x effect did not work on the tibia mariners so more research needs to be done on this ash of war). Hence, there should be a lore reason for it.\n\nThe description of the death knight helm reads-\n\n*\"Golden helm of the Death Knights, whose own death masks served as the* ***visards*** *of their armor. Enhances skills and incantations of the capital's ancient dragon cult. The decayed golden wheel that adorns it represents their unbroken loyalty to Godwyn, he who became Prince of Death.\"*\n\nNow \u2018visards\u2019 in the context of armor could be refering to \u2018visor\u2019 which means face coverings. But there is another definition that changes our perspective. Here it is on google-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59lfanc7siie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9100ceabb8e9a172edd94096005d316387200a5c\n\nSo visard is used for a \u2018disguise.\u2019 This raises the obvious question, what are the death knights disguising as? Death masks are typically made for dead people but considering that these guys do not receive the 2x damage from last rites and that one of their corpses can be found in the deathlight catacombs, they aren\u2019t exactly dead. So, they could be disguising as the dead to show their loyalty to Godwyn as the prince of death.\n\nAdmittedly this point is not as strong as the first one as I believe the death knights require a lot more of a thorough discussion and more research needs to be done on the death related enemies. However, I believe that the corpse we find in the darklight catacombs gives a very strong case for them not being \u2018dead,\u2019\n\nThese two points(first one mostly) prove that the lands of shadows must have been accessible after Godwyn\u2019s death.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere is the finished timeline-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w7kjuv8siie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f8395c6b05afd5496b6ee68be2a587aec188e5\n\nNow the reason behind Marika sealing Messmer is completely up to interpretation but for the sake of making the timeline make sense, I will give my breakdown of her motivations-\n\n\u00a0At this point in the timeline, she was going to destroy the golden order hence self-preservation cannot be a motive. There are several possible motives we can come up with but there is one that is supported the most and answers most of the questions, in my opinion. Messmer was sealed because in one of his visits the base serpent revealed itself somehow which caused the people to turn on him. Fearing for Messmer\u2019s life, especially after losing Godwyn, she sealed him in the shadow realm where he would be safe.\n\nHere is the evidence pointing towards this-\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u2019s look at Andreas\u2019s description again\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6joh3y9siie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91e39b71cdcd43f55e84444c7572d328b091fae\n\nLook at the part I underlined in yellow, Andreas somehow learned of Messmer\u2019s serpentine nature. This serpentine nature has to be the base serpent and not the winged serpents for 2 reasons- 1) the winged serpents are visible on messmer at all times and 2) the winged serpents are depicted on the serpent crest shield so they must have been common knowledge. This implies the base serpent must have been able to reveal itself on its own likely due to Marika\u2019s seal weakening overtime in the Land of shadows.\n\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Erdtree society hated serpents even before the crusade as we learn from the duelist helm description-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvizknacsiie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d43b59baa954e766e7be3f69a93fc4a310458db5\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese colosseums existed during Godfrey\u2019s era, when Messmer war around. The winged serpents are described as wise in the winged serpent helm description-\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\"Helm of Kood, captain of the Fire Knights. A winged serpent perches atop it. Enhances Fire Knight skills. The winged serpent is the token creature of Messmer's military forces. It is a wise friend which keeps the base serpent at bay and holds its power in check.\"*\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo they were likely tolerated as they weren\u2019t inherently evil but instead were wise. The base serpent on the other hand, would definitely cause an uproar.\n\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Correct me if I am wrong on this but the base serpent in the original Japanese description is called \u2018malevolent serpent\u2019 not base serpent. Either way it is called straight up evil in every item description which implies that it is not necessarily impure but inherently evil which would only make people hate it more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vknx2rvesiie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea589c29ccef90f4f226500aed20c1ad8956f3a4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ty6f06ofsiie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1b28737beb713c91cb03222f1202f984c06e8a3\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll this combined with the details about the timeline makes the set of events clear to me - After the night of the black knives, Messmer visited his mom again. During this visit, the base serpent somehow revealed itself to the public. This caused a massive uproar due the widespread hatred of serpents and the nature of the base serpent. All this pressure on top of the fact that Godwyn died made Marika fear for Messmer\u2019s life, so she sealed him away in the shadow realm where he would be safe. Due to the widespread scorn for Messmer, either Radagon or the people would remove all traces of him from history. This would make for another motive for Marika shattering the Elden ring. I do remember there being an interview with GRRM which said that the shattering happened 5000 years before we arrived so that is plenty of time for Messmer to be removed from history. This is just my speculation, so you can have your interpretation of events but I believe this is supported the most by facts and implications and explains a bunch of questions like the scorning.\n\nSome important counterpoints I need to refute-\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Messmer\u2019s remembrance-\n\nLike I said earlier, this is mistranslated, hence it is not a reliable source for determining Marika\u2019s motives. The original Japanese description states that Marika sealed Messmer even after placing the sealing grace in his eye, whereas the English translation incorrectly suggests that fear compelled her to do so. The English wording implies that Marika was driven by fear, suggesting that Messmer was immediately seen as a threat and scorned from the start. However, the Japanese version simply states that she sealed him nevertheless, which does not attribute her decision to fear but instead leaves room for other motivation such as the serpent revealing itself. This difference in wording is crucial because without the element of fear, there is no immediate reason to assume Messmer was rejected by society right away nor to assume Marika always intended to seal him. Instead, it supports the idea that he may have maintained public support for a considerable time before circumstances (his base serpent being revealed), led to his eventual exile. Then comes all the additional evidence that strongly implies Messmer returned so that would only refute this counterpoint further.\n\n\u00a0\n\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why does Messmer\u2019s armor say that Marika wanted him to take the blame for the crusade? -\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf this is what you think the armor description says then I have a lot to tell you, my friend.\n\nLet\u2019s look at what it is actually saying-\n\n*\"Black armor of Messmer the Impaler. Draped with a red cloak bearing his crest embroidered. On his mother's wishes, Messmer made himself a symbol of fear, undertaking the cleansing crusade she desired. \"Direct thy maledictions, thine ire, and thy grief towards me alone.\" \"*\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat does this tell us for a fact? It tells us that Marika wished for Messmer to purge the hornsent and make them fear him. He simply became a symbol of fear to them for revenge not necessarily to everyone. Now for some reason people think the \u2018direct thy maledictions, thine ire, and thy grief towards me alone\u2019 part means Messmer took the blame for the crusade. With all due respect, this take just makes no sense for 2 reasons-\n\ni)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why would he need to take the blame for the crusade? The only reason I have seen people throw around is that the crusade \u2018became too violent\u2019 which makes no sense for 2 reasons- 1) the Land of Shadows (LOS in short) was veiled during the crusade as we can see in the story trailer so how would anybody know it was violent? \u2019Oh someone could have travelled to LOS and seen the crusade.\u2019 Marika is likely the only person capable of allowing travel between the realms, why would she allow a random noble to go to the LOS which is literally the place where all manners of death wash up. Why would any noble want to wander into the LOS anyway like they would know that is the place where the hornsent reside, you know the race of people racist to everyone without horns, and where death washes up. If you believe that the place was forgotten early in the timeline then that would also support this. 2) Even if they knew it was violent why would the people of the erdtree mind it? Like they are fine with butchering omen babies and sticking their horns on the side of a cleaver and all the fucked up bulshit happening to albunaurics at volcano manor (we do see tortured albunaurics at Leynedell right before the entrance to the sewers so its likely that the society was fine with torturing the albunaurics). If they are fine with these practices, why would they take issue with the race of horned people who made the lives of all those living without horns(and even themselves lol) miserable? It just makes no sense, Messmer would not have to take the blame for anything.\n\nii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Let\u2019s translate what those last lines mean into simple english-\n\n\"Direct thy maledictions, thine ire, and thy grief towards me alone\" means:\n\n\"Send all your curses, anger, and sorrow to me only.\"\n\nIf we were to consider that Messmer is speaking to the erdtree people then the first two words make sense, \u2018curses\u2019 and \u2018anger\u2019, but then comes sorrow. What would the erdtree people be sorrowful of? Nothing! They lose nothing from the purge of the hornsent. Don\u2019t say that \u2018Oh they lost their sons who became fire knights\u2019 They did not, they shunned them after scorning Messmer as the fire knights were chased due to their allegiance to Messmer according to the fire knight helm description-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w6yixhmxsiie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7b1d1c7fe5b196b20a57698a6711132eaf4b699\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0This means they had no reason for being sorrowful before shunning Messmer. It is logically impossible for Messmer to be addressing the erdtree people here.\n\nWho is he addressing then? It is likely the hornsent. He is asking them to curse him and not Marika. The hornsent npc, the grandam and some of the ghosts curse both Messmer and Marika to hell and back. No other npc curses Messmer in any way so it must be them. Messmer seems to have the hornless hornsent in his keep so he might have a little sympathy for them(who those guys are is completely up to interpretation but yeah).\n\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why does Messmer curse Marika with his dying breath? This would imply that she abandoned him, right? \u2013\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo. He curses her due to the shattering of the elden ring and partly due the influence of the base serpent. Messmer knew why he was sealed and was perfectly fine with it. However, when the Elden Ring was shattered, it was seen as a sign of wrath according to the wrath from afar description.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\"An Erdtree incantation discovered in the realm of shadow.*\n\n*Fires a golden shockwave that knocks back nearby foes.*  \n*Charging increases the size of the shockwave.*\n\n*When the Elden Ring was shattered, the people of the realm of shadow felt it too\u2014and feared it as a sign of the Erdtree's wrath\"*\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis would make Messmer have doubts which would turn into resentment. This resentment however, is overshadowed by his loyalty and love towards his mother as shown by him having only love and reverence when he speaks of her; her statue in his room is the only one with its head intact. Even when he sees the player character (who is lightless) being chosen as lord he still speaks highly of her. He is repressing his resentment like how he is repressing the base serpent. He only curses her when the base serpent takes over. That thing is stated to be evil in multiple item descriptions as I have said earlier and thematically it represents Messmer\u2019s repressed aspects so it is not much of a stretch to assume that it would amplify any repressed negative feelings Messmer would have once it takes over. So, what we gather is that 1) Messmer shows nothing but sheer reverence towards Marika before letting the base serpent take over him and 2) that the base serpent is called evil in all item descriptions which implies that it amplifies all negative emotions and thematically it represents Messmer\u2019s repressed aspects. This means Messmer was fine with being sealed until the Elden ring was shattered which caused him to have some amount of resentment which increased when he saw us. When he removed the seal, these feelings were amplified and he cursed his mother. I AM NOT SAYING THAT IT TOOK OVER HIS MIND. Him cursing her is a tragic irony, he feels abandoned due the shattering and that feeling grows larger when he sees us. When the base serpent takes over his feeling of resentment is amplified and when the tarnished kills him, he finally lets the resentment take over and curse Marika. They both wanted the best for each other but circumstances led to this predicament.\n\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why does the divine beast site of grace point towards Messmer? If Marika wants to protect him then why send us to kill him?(This obviously makes the assumption that Marika is controlling grace. if you do not think Marika controls grace then this is completely irrelevant )\n\n\u00a0That grace does not point towards Messmer at all, it points towards scadutree avatar, you know the boss holding Miquella\u2019s great rune-\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zon37r9ksiie1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7c9323ed0edeb5a28e4b2a2245b0b8b4ba4ed48\n\nMarika is pointing towards Miquella. At this point he is falling into the same trap of godhood as her so she is trying to spare him from that. However, we are too late and he sheds his great rune. Notice how no other site of grace points towards Messmer. Marika is telling the tarnished to just take the great rune and get out of the shadow realm so that Messmer does not get killed. It is Dane and Leda\u2019s notes that tell us to kill Messmer so in a way Miquella got Messmer killed so an angle of revenge is possible.\n\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why is there nothing related to Radagon and golden order fundamentalism in the shadow realm?\n\nWell first we need to ask ourselves, how is Radagon\u2019s relationship with Messmer? Messmer loves his mom so let us see how Marika and Radagon are characterised when it comes to each other. Marika and Radagon are at constant odds in every piece of characterisation we get for them (Marika calling him a leal hound so basically calling him a dog, their opposing goals when it came to the elden ring and the golden order) so Marika does not like him very much. Remember the game never states who called back Radagon to become elden lord, it\u2019s likely that Radagon came back out of his own volition or by order of the two fingers as Marika goes from personally bestowing blessings in the age of plenty to going practically inert during Radagon\u2019s age (not a single item description talks about her actions during this time) until the shattering and on the other hand, Radagon is creating golden order fundamentalism and doing all sorts of stuff which implies he became the more dominant half during his age. If Marika\u2019s goal was to simply stay in power then she would not allow this(I do not believe her motive was to stay in power at all but that is way too big a conversation to fit here). Therefore, Marika was likely at odds with Radagon from the beginning of his age. She even has dialogue with Godfrey at the third church of Marika and the church of pilgrimage about establishing a new age with him so her being at odds with Radagon checks out. (Marika may have even used the Realm of shadow to preserve Godfrey\u2019s practices awaiting his return though this is just a headcannon) Messmer is completely loyal to Marika so it\u2019s not much of a stretch to say he would dislike Radagon for being at odds with his mother. Him disliking Radagon would mean that he would want nothing from Radagon and hence would not have anything related to golden order fundamentalism in the land of shadows.\n\n6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why do Messmer\u2019s armies in the lands of shadow ask Marika for a sign to end the crusade? Would that not imply that she said nothing to Messmer? -\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, Messmer could have simply chosen to keep that business a secret and continue the crusade for the sake of revenge. When his armies got mad, he let them decapitate Marika\u2019s statues instead of telling them the truth as then his secret would be known by even more people causing more rebellions, which he did not want as that would result in him killing more of his comrades.\n\n7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Shadow lands militiamen armor description and them not knowing bestial incantations-\n\nI am not exactly sure whether this would even count as a counter point but I wanted to explain it and this is where I felt it fit best. Here is the description-\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\"Armor as dark as shadow, worn by vulgar militiamen.*\n\n\u00a0*Freshly-singed battlegrounds effusing with the stench of the dead.*\n\n\u00a0*Forbidden lands that will be excised from the memory of history.*\n\n\u00a0*What better place than the realms of shadow then, for such an army?\"*\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, the claim that people have made with this description is that it is saying that there was an attempt to excise the shadow realm from memory (they claim it is by Marika but its likely Radagon or the erdtree society which I already explained earlier) with reference to the 3^(rd) line \u2018*Forbidden lands that will be excised from the memory of history.*\u2019 To those who say this, I humbly request you read the 2^(nd) line and the 3^(rd) line together, \u2018*Freshly-singed battlegrounds effusing with the stench of the dead. Forbidden lands that will be excised from the memory of history.*\u2019 That 3^(rd) line is talking about the battlegrounds where the militiamen used to fight, not the lands of shadow. Also, the one from the base game says the exact same thing-\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\"Armor worn by lean, mean, and filthy militiamen.*\n\n*Freshly-singed battlegrounds effusing with the stench of the dead.*\n\n\u00a0*Forbidden lands that will be excised from the memory of history.*\n\n*This is where the vulgar militia serve, as untiring, unsung watchkeepers.\"*\n\n\u00a0\n\nHence this confirms that the two lines are not in reference to the lands of shadow but to these battlegrounds. Also, if you want to claim that this description implies that the fire giants were removed from history, you would be incorrect according to the visage shield item decription-\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\"Tricksome bronze shield depicting the face of a Fire Giant.*  \n*Several tongues leap from its open mouth.*\n\n*The dreadful visage and burning flames are designed to remind one of the horror of facing a Fire Giant. In other words, this shield has an instructional function.\"*\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese guys are found in caelid and in front of the dectus lift so they must have been well known. They resemble the fire giants hence they must have been remembered. This means the forbidden lands mentioned in the armor description is not in reference to the mountaintops. So characteristically Marika is not really shown to have removed the history of anything besides maybe the hornsent but it can also be argued that she gathered all the people discriminated by them during the beginning so they would already despise the hornsent and hence crucible related beings, so the people would hate the hornsent and hence remember them due to the hatred. They would forget their culture sure, but they would certainly remember their atrocities. Before you try to say \u201cOh she removed them because \u2018insert some headconnon about Marika\u2019s ascension which basically says she did not want the secrets of godhood to be out or something.\u2019 \u201d remember, Marika\u2019s ascension is left very vague and up to interpretation. Your headcannon is just as valid as mine, hence neither really works as an argument. Marika might just have ascended by reaching the gates via her mimic veil, she then veiled the shadow realm and went on to find people that would join her. The betrayal could simply be a slave rebellion sort of thing or maybe Marika just tricked the hornsent into letting her to the gates. The stakes of Marika seem to be wearing the commoner headband, if she has depictions of her as a commoner it would be logical to assume that at first she just went around gathering allies and healing people before fully transforming into a queen and going on her conquests. So people would have good reason to have faith in her at the beginning. All this speculation I just did not the beginning of her godhood is just a mere headcannon but it is logical and fits in with characterisation as all the erdtree spells are healing spells and not to mention that she personally gave out blessings during the age of plenty. When things are left this vague and up to interpretation, we look at how the rest of the characterisation is and that is far too lengthy of a conversation to fit here(like I could talk about how perfumer lore make her feelings towards omens and misbegotten more complex, about which war crimes were done by Radagon and not by her etc. It is just far too much). There are just far too many actions for me to explain in depth in just a single post. I will end this mini rant by saying that there is no concrete piece of evidence saying Marika removed Messmer\u2019s history (also applied to the hornsent and fire giants) but environmental implications suggest that she tried to preserve his memory so it is very unlikely that it was her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe last line, \u2018*What better place than the realms of shadow then, for such an army?*\u2019 Simply is a reference to the fact that the lands of shadows is forgotten. The description is not exactly saying that the lands of shadows were excised from history just that it was forgotten. It was forgotten either due to the shattering taking people\u2019s focus or Radagon/ the society removed the history of the place. It does not in any way shape or form say Marika removed the place\u2019s history. Environmental details like the stone tablets being the same in Marika\u2019s bedchambers and the shadow keep and the impalers catacombs still existing imply that Marika tried to keep his memory. Hence it was not Marika who was responsible for Messmer\u2019s removal from history.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow the militiamen in the shadow lands do not use any bestial incantations. Many claim that this supports the lands of shadows being sealed before the night of the black knives. Here are some counterpoints to this-\n\ni)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those guys are stated to have been looked down upon in the lands between(the wording of the description kind of implies that this was a normal thing in the lands between even before Marika)\n\n\u201c*Spirits of the vulgar militia who wield long-hafted, serrated hatchets. These brutal weapons are particularly effective at causing blood loss to opponents.*  \n*In the Lands Between, the small were scorned, and so they formed their vulgar militia as a means to make a living, albeit in ignominy.*\u201d\n\nSince the small were scorned, they would naturally not be allowed back and had to stay at their posts. Messmer and other high ranking members were able to return because at the beginning, they were supported.\n\nii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am pretty sure its not stated when exactly Malekith hired the vulgar militiamen. It could very well be possible that he hired them after the shattering so that would also explain the lack of bestial incantations.\n\n8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does this fit in with Characterisation? -\n\nNow characterising Marika would require a very long discussion (like tens of thousands of words long if I am being honest because I will have to cover nearly every aspect of the lore) so I would say that we are better off just focusing on all the Messmer related stuff. We get one item description that to my knowledge is not mistranslated which tells us something definitive about Messmer\u2019s and Marika\u2019s relationship, the blessing of Marika-\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\"A special physick blessed by Marika, the queen of the Erdtree.*\n\n*Completely restores HP and heals all ailments.*\n\n*Marika once created several of these physicks for Messmer's sake.*  \n*But never again.\"*\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe \u2018But never again\u2019 could either be a reference to how she could have made these after the night of the black knives right before sealing Messmer away to protect him. The line \u2018*Marika once created several of these physicks for Messmer's sake*\u2019 reveals the motive behind making these, for Messmer\u2019s sake alone. No implication of an ulterior motive here, just to help Messmer. Marika made this out of love for him. This means that Marika trying to protect Messmer would fit in with established characterisation.\n\nLike I said multiple times before, I could write another thousand words on how Marika is characteristically shown to have been doubting the golden order and how it is Radagon who does everything to preserve the golden order but that is way too big of a conversation to reasonably fit here.\n\n\u00a0EDIT: To clear up some confusion about the sealing of the shadow realm and the timeline-\n\nThe shadow realm had two things happen to it-\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The shadow land was veiled (the place was hidden but traveling there was possible): During Marika\u2019s ascension to godhood, she veiled the lands BUT THERE WAS STILL A WAY TO TRAVEL BETWEEN THE LAND OF SHADOWS AND THE LANDS BETWEEN which likely only she could access. The veiling must have happened before Messmer\u2019s crusade because in the story trailer we see that Messmer is assaulting Belurat when the lands of shadow is veiled. Why do I think the place was veiled at Marika\u2019s ascension? It is heavily implied that the Scadutree is responsible for the veil and the Scadutree avatar\u2019s remembrance says-\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Remembrance of the Scadutree Avatar, hewn into the Scadutree.*\n\n*The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.*\n\n*The Scadutree is the shadow of the Erdtree.*  \n*Born of dark notions that bear no sense of Order, that twist and bend its stock, rendering it brittle.*\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Scadutree is called the shadow of the Erdtree which along with the line from the story trailer \u2018gold arose and shadow too was born\u2019 implies that when the erdtree was born so too was the scadutree.\n\nThe shadow lands were sealed (all forms of travel were cut off): This, as I have proven in this post, happened after the knight of the black knives.\n\nThat covers everything in detail. Once again, if someone fluent in Japanese is reading this, please confirm if the things said in this post about the original Messmer\u2019s remembrance description is accurate. Any form of feedback will be appreciated, have a good day!",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to my most ambitious post ever. I'm not sure how it will be received but I hope people will be open minded. Any feedback is welcome. For a summary of my proposed timeline:\n\n* Godfrey defeats Serosh and takes him as regent.\n* Fortified Manor is built near the young Erdtree sapling.\n* Expansion starts. Probably war with giants first then march southwards till Liurnia roadblocks Marika's forces \n* Liurnian Wars, Radagon leads the army, ends in marriage. Meanwhile Leyndell grew closer to the modern version we see.\n* Caria and Liurnia as a whole accept Marika's faith. Saint is established as a figurehead of this and bridges to the Divine Towers are built. Note that at this point Godfrey's march is around Limgrave only. Why Caelid has no bridge to the Divine Tower. Manus Cathedrals are built. Sorcerers renounce soul transfer via primal glintstone. \n* Stormveil gets built. \n* Arenas are built.\n* Godfrey war campaign ends, his Grace is taken away and sent into exile.\n\nThat's what I got so far. It's not all encompassing but it paints a good enough picture. I really hope I didn't overlook some minor detail in an item that wrecks this whole thing. And if you're curious about the Walking Mausoleums, that's my biggest question too. \n\nProbably a lot of people will ask why can't Caria worship fingers on their own so let me address it here. Caria and Marika's people both worshipping the Fingers but being in conflict seems weird to me. The Fingers clearly favor Marika and guided her. The Finger Reader corpses before her Bedchamber clearly show the Fingers still held a strong role in Erdtree society and faith till the end. And like I said Caria never uses the Saint in anything except finger related buildings, it doesn't seem native to them. Otherwise we'd see him in Caria Manor or the Academy too right? And again it's weird for the Saint to be a symbol of worship for 2 separate warring factions. I just can't see how he can be some relic of a former culture that both Caria and Godfrey picked up, it's too contrived.\n\n* [Part 1 - Fingers and Rings](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1i9o9nn/visual_exploration_series_part_1_fingers_and_rings/)\n* [Part 2 - Hornsent and death rituals](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1ibg8gv/visual_exploration_series_part_2_hornsent_and/)\n* [Part 3 - Marika churches](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1ieftj7/visual_exploration_series_part_3_marikas_churches/)\n* [Part 4 - Farum Azula cut storm](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1ig4qcl/visual_exploration_series_part_4_farum_azula/)\n* [Part 5 - Marika shadowlands churches are Sellian](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1ihpoya/sellian_churches_in_the_lands_of_shadow_visual/)\n* [Part 6 - Meteors, miners and crystal formation ](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1iiwfyd/visual_exploration_series_part_6_meteors_miners/)\n* [Part 7 - Gelmir snake religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1ilh5by/visual_exploration_series_part_7_snakes_of_gelmir/)\n* [Part 8 - Marais family, fire monks, more Gelmir](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1inry55/visual_exploration_series_part_8_marais_family/)",

Let me know what do you think.**\n\nWe have those two items that i think are the most crucial.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nxluthtph7hd1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaeb0c1932a213748dcab2e17b2d77fc77a54cd3\n\n**Blackflame Monk Armor**\n\n*The Blackflame Monks, enthralled by the god-slaying black flame, became traitors, abandoning their posts as guardians.

I don't think it's reasonable to assume Fire Monks would abandon their posts and joined already defeated remnants of Godskins in that case. And how would they even know about black flame if Godskins were already defeated and Golden Order established?**\n\n**I think the only thing that makes sense here it to take this description at face value and assume Blackflame still had it's godslaying properties after the \"War of the Giants\" ended and fire monks started to watch over it.**\n\n**Let's look more into Blackflame itself**\n\nWe know that blackflame lost it's properties when Maliketh sealed destined death.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezt6lusyh7hd1.jpg?width=200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d2e38a7cfc19cd84967cd734ead3bc555a7cec2\n\n**Godslayer's Greatsword**\n\n*Sacred sword of the Gloam-Eyed Queen who controlled the Godskin Apostles before her defeat at the hands of Maliketh.

But after their defeat by Maliketh, the Black Blade, the source of their power was sealed away.*\n\n**I'm curious why sword called sacred and was it nesessary to defeat GEQ and Godskins to seal away destined death or this description just stated the order of events. Anyway, let's continue.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53ncvf70k7hd1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bea05addb271a0f0980dc8ca84371d06ad3e9c05\n\n**Remembrance of the Black Blade**\n\n*Maliketh was a shadowbound beast given to his Empyrean.*  \n*Marika's sole need of her shadow was a vessel to lock away Destined Death.*  \n*Even then, she betrayed him.*\n\n**Mending Rune of the Death-Prince**\n\n*The Golden Order was created by confining Destined Death. Thus, this new Order will be one of Death restored.*\n\n**Finger Reader Enia dialogue**\n\n*The Rune of Death goes by two names; the other is Destined Death.*\u00a0The forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation...\n\n**With this we can be sure that:**\n\n**1. Golden Order was stablished after \"War of the Giants\".**\n\n**2. GEQ was still active during this time since blackflame godslaying powers were intact.**\n\n**Let's go back to this war**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64mkf8i9s7hd1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6d70d239d1da8bb27f697916cd51e556c76a815\n\n**Elden Lord Crown**\n\n*Crown of Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.*\n\n*The age of the Erdtree began amongst conflict, when Godfrey was lord of the battlefield.*\n\n*He led the War against the Giants. Faced the Storm Lord, alone. And then, there came a moment. When his last worthy enemy fell. And it was then, as the story is told, that the hue of Lord Godfrey's eyes faded.*\n\n**When resting at\u00a0First Church of Marika Site of Grace**\n\n*In Marika's own words.\u00a0Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. Guidance has delivered ye through ordeal to the place ye stand. Put the giants to the sword and confine the flame atop the mount. Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.

The Erdtree seed of this talisman was presumed to be an object of myth. This age-old artifact also depicts the Two Fingers, perhaps harking back to the birth of the Erdtree.*\n\n**Flame, Protect Me**\n\n*The most ancient of the Fire Monks' incantations.*\n\n*It is said that this incantation was used during the War against the\u00a0Giants long ago, during which it protected the champions of the\u00a0Erdtree.*\n\n**Surge, O Flame!**\n\n*Superior incantation of the Fire Monks.*\n\n*The Giants' Flame is the flame of ruin, capable of burning the*  \n*Erdtree.

But through countless victories in war, it became the embodiment of Order.*\n\n**So, with this we can be sure that War of the Giants took place in the earlier days of the Erdtree and in the very earlier days of Marika's rule (because of the first church). But at the same time Godfrey was already first Elden Lord so that means Marika was a god. Though victories Erdtree became embodiment of Order.**\n\n**So my proposed timeline is:**\n\n**1/2 Marika becomes a god/Godfrey is the first Elden Lord.**\n\n**1/2 Erdtree is \"born\" from seeds of the Two Fingers.**\n\n*I'm not sure what happened first but those events should be close in a grand scheme of things and it doesn't really matter in out case.*\n\n**3. War with the Giants. Beginning of the era of the Erdtree. Flame Monks start to watch over the flame.**\n\n**4. Some of the Monks break their vow and swear fealty to the god-slaying black flame. Amon is the first to do so.**\n\n**5. GEQ and Apostles are defeated by Maliketh**\n\n**6. Golden Order is established by removal of the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring and confining it in the Maliketh's Black Blade.**\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have any counter points?",

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "To start the timeline let us look at the Remembrance of Metyr, Mother of Fingers which reads:\n\n[Remembrance of Metyr](https://preview.redd.it/9cekhkhdu7bd1.jpg?width=272&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91a1eab94ca698b542bc63c497fcc640e3efb77d)\n\n*Remembrance of Metyr, the Mother of Fingers, hewn into the Scadutree. The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.* ***The mother of all Two Fingers and Fingercreepers was in turn a magnificently gleaming daughter of the Greater Will, and the first shooting star to fall upon the Lands Between.***\n\nFrom Metyr's Remembrance, we find out that Metyr was the **first** shooting star to fall upon the Lands Between. Since the Greater Will, from the base game, has only been shown to interact with the Lands Between either through intermediaries(Two Fingers/Finger Readers in the present) or by sending fallingstar beasts(Astel with the Nox/Elden Beast). So since there were no intermediaries before Metyr( who gave birth to the Fingers) and Metyr was the first shooting star to fall upon the Lands Between, this makes for an interesting conclusion. **Metyr, being the first shooting star falling upon the Lands Between, was the very first instance of the Greater Will interacting with the Lands between.** So essentially, the arrival of Metyr marks the first interaction of the Greater Will with the Lands Between\n\nThe point where the Greater Will began interacting with the Lands Between seems like the best place to start the Timeline of Elden Ring considering everything that happens lorewise.\n\nNow after the arrival of Metyr, I will put forward a sequence of events until the end of the Rule of Placidusax which I believe match with the item descriptions given in game but the exact specifics are impossible to know for sure.\n\nSo now Metyr arrives in the Lands Between. From the items we get from Metyr's Remembrance we can learn more about this daughter of the Greater Will. First, the Staff of Beyond states:\n\n[Staff of the Great Beyond](https://preview.redd.it/a7fz8ikgu7bd1.jpg?width=270&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb804517c8c99673433d89e505fbfdb4c2cc190a)\n\n*Staff fashioned from the tail-fingers of Metyr, the Mother of Fingers, and the microcosm raised aloft over the crux they form. Catalyst for casting both sorceries and incantations.* ***The Mother received signs from the Greater Will from the beyond of the microcosm***\\*. Despite being broken and abandoned, she kept waiting for another message to come.\\*\n\nSo we see that Metyr after arrival received signs from the Greater Will. But either soon after Metyr arrived or for some other reason stopped receiving messages from the Greater Will.\n\nThe other item we can get in Metyr's Remembrance is the Gazing Finger, which is *the head of Metyr, the finger-mother, wielded as a weapon without modification.* The more interesting we can learn from this weapon is from its Ash of War: Kowtowers Resentment\n\n*Skill performed as a violent bow using a finger's foremost protrusion.* ***Resentment builds as it is forced to bow, making it explode with anger***\\*. Hold button down to further increase resentment.\\*\n\nThis is very interesting to me and suggests both that Metyr believes that itself to be an inherently superior being to those in the Lands between and that Metyr does not care for whatever kind of order or regime rules over the Lands Between as long as it is not forced to bow. And in the Lands Between which is a land mired in conquest, to not bow means to rule.\n\nComing back to the timeline where Metyr arrives in the Lands Between. I am not certain of the exact races or species that were already in the Lands Between but since the ancient dragons have been shown to be one of the first ruling classes in the Lands Between, I think it is safe to assume that when Metyr arrives, the ancient dragons were either already in dominion of the Lands between or had the power, through many conflicts, become the embodiment of order\n\nSo how does Metyr obtain control over the order of Ancient Dragons?\n\nFrom the Staff of Beyond we learned that Metyr received \"signs\" from the Greater Will. I believe the first (and possibly only) sign the Greater Will sent Metyr was the Elden Beast. The Elden Stars Description states:\n\n[Elden Stars](https://preview.redd.it/pz8gijfsu7bd1.jpg?width=259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e81f2d420fe2fa1245c0f7110b0cb8d49823f92)\n\n*This legendary incantation is the most ancient of those that derive from the Erdtree.*\n\n*Creates a stream of golden shooting stars that assail the area.*\n\n***It is said that long ago,***  \n***the Greater Will sent a golden star bearing a beast into the Lands Between,***  \n***which would later become the Elden Ring.***\n\nThe golden star bearing the Elden Beast arrives as a \"sign\" the Greater Will for Metyr. With the arrival of the Elden Beast, Metyr can take over the ancient dragons as it will for many other orders in the future. That is,through a lord and a god.\n\nThe lord is obviously the Dragonlord Placidusax, but many speculate on the god of Placidusax who fled. I believe this god to be the Elden Beast itself. The Elden Remembrance states:\n\n[Elden Remembrance](https://preview.redd.it/sj1evq3vu7bd1.jpg?width=271&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8372b40470ff575c5811ca4d8790b36e4fb4a11c)\n\n*Remembrance of the Elden Beast, hewn into the Erdtree.*\n\n*The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.*  \n*Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.*\n\n***It was the vassal beast of the Greater Will and living incarnation of the concept of Order.***\n\nThe Elden Beast was the **vassal** beast of the Greater Will and would later become the Elden Ring.\n\nMetyr would start the cycle off taking over orders with a lord and a god which would continue many times. But the first cycle was with the Elden Beast as the god and Placidusax as the Beast's Lord Consort. Metyr would continue this cycle ages into the future with Marika as the vessel of the Elden Ring( which is what the Elden Beast would later become) and Godfrey as Marika's Lord Consort.\n\nWe know that Marika's ascension to godhood in her era was to become the vessel of the Elden Ring, which is what the Elden Beast later became. So essentially Marika became a god by becoming a vessel for the later form of the Elden Beast. So for the first cycle, I believe the Elden Beast served as the god with Placidusax as the consort and another vessel was not needed to host the Elden Beast the first time.\n\nNow why do I believe the Elden Beast itself served as the God in Farum Azula? The main reason I have is from the depiction of the Elden Ring in Farum Azula:\n\n[Hairlike Extensions](https://preview.redd.it/q2f3wirxu7bd1.jpg?width=341&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3116617404e5b5a5e70029d23e946205d3d7537b)\n\nI believe this depiction is of the Elden Beast itself. Now this part is a bit of visual speculation, but after going through the base game and the DLC, we get no info on the hair like extensions on the end of the Elden Ring here. From the info we have in the base game, we assume that this is the Elden Ring before it was adopted by Marika. But there is no specific information on what marika changed from the old order of the ancient dragon that would change the shape of the Elden Ring that much(We know the ancient dragons were immortal so rune of death doesn't matter). Specifically, I assumed that this Elden Ring was the Elden RIng of the primordial Erdtree, however it is shown now that the Age of the crucible came about with the hornsent and that there was a good amount of time between the rule of Placidusax and the Hornsent culture.\n\nSo if the Farum Azula Elden Ring doesn't depict the primordial Elden Ring why do I believe it is depicting the Elden Beast itself?\n\nWhen we fight the Elden Beast it does this attack:\n\n[Elden Ring Attack](https://preview.redd.it/shom1691v7bd1.jpg?width=1679&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b6ffe378ead9597f138c6e1f098601f54a88c2)\n\nNow I might be wrong but I believe that this is the closest thing in game resembling the Farum Azula Elden RIng Depiction. More interesting is the tail of the elden beast which is covered by the character but is easier to see in the following picture:\n\n[Hair like tail](https://preview.redd.it/9sob0vl4v7bd1.jpg?width=984&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=670e3704f571a2e06fe8a3db6b0f7563e94b7e1e)\n\nCredit to BonfireVN on youtube for these pictures(Also another interesting thing from BonfireVN's video to note is that the internal AI name for the Elden Beast is **NebulaDragon**).From these pictures, and the fact that we get no additional information about a primordial Elden Ring, I believe that the Farum Azula Elden RIng depicts the Elden Beast which acted as the vassal god for the Ancient Dragons with Placidusax as its Elden Lord. I also believe that the Elden Beast was under Metyr's control\n\nIn the base-game, we see that the Elden Beast never proactively does anything. The Elden Beast has imprisoned Marika(divine punishment attack) only as a response to the shattering of the Elden Ring and attacks us when we take down Radagon who is the current vessel of the Elden Ring.\n\nSince the Elden Beast is shown to have no autonomy, I believe that Metyr was able to control or have knowledge on how to harness the Elden Beast as a daughter of the Greater Will. Now there isn't direct proof that Metyr was controlling the Elden Beast, but considering the information we learn from Kowtowers Resentment it doesn't seem like Metyr would be happy being equal or below the Elden beast. And the fact that the Elden Beast and later the Elden Ring seems more like a power to be harnessed rather than a sentient being, makes me speculate that Metyr was able to control/harness the power the Elden Beast.\n\nMarika was a shaman who had to ascend to a god allowed her to become the vessel of the Elden Ring, which is what the Elden Ring would become. But since the Elden Beast was the Elden Ring itself, no ascension was necessary and the Elden Beast was considered a god already.\n\nSo just as the God Marika and her consort Godfrety were able to establish dominion over the Lands Between through conquest, the Consort Placidusax and his god the Elden beast were able to establish dominion over the Lands Between in this older era.\n\nEventually, the rule of the Ancient Dragons is established with Placidusax as the Elden Lord as a result of his god the Elden Beast. The capital of this kingdom is in Farum Azula(which is probably still connected to the Lands Between near Caelid). This capital which we see in the base game is ruled by Ancient Dragons whom are served by Beastmen.\n\nIt is shown that the Ancient Dragons were blessed with the grace of gold from the Gravel Stone Seal which we can see from the Gravel Stone Seal Description:\n\n*Sacred seal made from Gravel Stone thought to be an ancient dragon scale. Enhances Dragon Cult incantations of the Royal Capital.*\n\n***The worship of the ancient dragons does not conflict with belief in the Erdtree. After all, this seal, and lightning itself, are both imbued with gold.***\n\nI also believe that the Beastmen were also blessed with the grace of gold which we can see in the \"intelligence\" they gain from Bestial Constitution Spell\n\n*Incantation taught by Gurranq, the Beast Clergyman.*\n\n*Fills the body with bestial vigor, alleviating buildup of frost and blood loss.*\n\n***Having gained intelligence***\\*, the beasts must have felt how their wildness slipped away as civilization took hold.\\*\n\nThe Ancient Dragons and the Beastmen who served them gained the grace of gold under the rule of the Elden Lord Placidusax. To note about Farum Azula, it seems all the ancient dragons and beastmen saw Placidusax as the ruler with only a few in the higher echelons of the order privy to the god, the Elden Beast. There is only one depiction all throughout Farum Azula, yet we know that Placidusax was the Elden Lord and that the Ancient Dragons were blessed with the grace of gold. I believe that the Elden Beast only really interacted with Placidusax and maybe a few higher up clergy man were able to witness the Elden Beast who viewed it as a dragon god that was unfathomable.\n\nI believe the Two Fingers were not born from Metyr at the time that Placidusax became Lord of the Dragons, since there is no evidence of Two Fingers/Fingercreepers in Farum Azula. So without a way to communicate with the other Ancient Dragons, Metyr can only control the Elden Beast who seems to be only able to communicate with Placidusax directly. I assume that Placidusax is the only one to be able to communicate with the Elden Beast is because after his \"god\" fled, he is actively trying to communicate with it when we walk into his arena:\n\n[Inspiration for Two-Fingers?](https://preview.redd.it/un8w6l27v7bd1.jpg?width=596&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2684daac19f68db3f13139321259b29026ed1cc5)\n\nMetyr succeeded in establishing a god of a new order, however Metyr would come to find out that this god had too little influence over the order it resided over.\n\nPlacidusax, being able to communicate with the Elden Beast and carry out the wishes of Metyr allowed him to rule over the Ancient Dragons. The Great Lord Placidusax was seen as the pinnacle, and the ancient dragons/beastmen who served him were blessed with the grace of gold. Metyr being at the top of this order was content and perhaps it went on for a couple millennia. These are Ancient Dragons, and time is nothing for these immortal beings.\n\nHowever, Metyr forgot one thing: In the Land Between, only strength befits a crown. The Dragonlord Placidusax, though a fearsome king of dragons, was no god. Even though the Dragonlord subjugated all foes before and became king, he would soon meet his match in Bayle the Dread.\n\nAncient Dragon Florissax tells us when we meet her in the Realm of Shadow:\n\n*\"In a time long past,* ***Bayle turned upon the Dragonlord. The foul traitor assailed our master and inflicted a grievous wound***\\*, only to make a hasty retreat.\"\\*\n\nAnd from the Talisman of the Dread:\n\n[Talisman of the Dread](https://preview.redd.it/4xs18bo9v7bd1.jpg?width=337&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=944d95f3367396b73e33e92cef0e521ef8c26aa3)\n\n\\*Talisman depicting the dread dragon of the jagged peak, whose roars cause the peak's molten fury to boil and churn. Raises potency of magma. Bayle was the foul dragon's name\u2014\\****a terrible harbinger of destruction whose challenge to the ancient Dragonlord ended in grievous mutual injury.***\n\nFrom these we can see that Bayle was originally a dragon serving the Dragonlord before turning upon him.   Bayle the Dread proved to be a harbinger of the destruction of the Age that Placidusax reigned over. Bayle's challenge is said to have ended in **grievous mutual injury**, meaning that even though the Placidusax succeeded in holding Bayle off the Dragonlord would sustain grievous injuries himself. We can see evidence of this in the game with some of Placidusax's heads missing and in the DLC, the heads are found biting on Bayle.\n\nThe reson for why Bayle turned upon the Dragonlord can be seen from the description of Bayle's Tyranny which states:\n\n*One of the greatest Dragon Communion incantations. Harnesses the fearsome power of Bayle the Dread. Channels the form of the dread dragon to emit a mighty roar accompanied by a heatwave burst, causing violent eruptions of fire in the area.* ***Even after being consumed, the throbbing heart of Bayle continues to resist its subjugation***\\*, never weakening. One day, the fire within will consume the very body and soul of its Communion devourer. One day.\\*\n\nMuch like Metyr ironically, Bayle the Dread resisted subjugation and challenged the Dragonlord for this reason. In order to resist subjugation in the Lands Between, one must conquer.\n\nThis fact is made clearer to Metyr, whose Elden Lord is grievously injured and definitely cannot withstand another challenger. Metyr is not able to guide the order through the Elden Beast since it is only able to communicate through Placidusax. Metyr learns of the dangers of relying only on the Lord to control the order. By creating a vessel for the vassal beast, who is able to communicate with the denizens of the order, Metyr would be able to control and guide the order to ensure she stays in power.\n\nWith this newfound knowledge in the error of the Order Metyr created, and the Dragonlord grievously injured, Metyr flees the Dragonlord with the Elden Beast to create a new Order:\n\n[Remembrance of the Dragonlord](https://preview.redd.it/xuz01d9cv7bd1.jpg?width=241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7a9bc35192e7d8f032ad96872a879c2b1d0380)\n\n*Remembrance of Dragonlord Placidusax, hewn into the Erdtree.*\n\n*The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.*  \n*Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.*\n\n*The Dragonlord whose seat lies at the heart of the storm beyond\u00a0time*  \n*is said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the Erdtree.*\u00a0  \n***Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return***\\*.\\*\n\nThe Dragonlord Placidusax who was the only one who could communicate with the Elden Beast, tried to communicate with its god, but recieved no answer. And thus continued to wait for time immemorial, awaiting a response which would never come again.\n\nI believe this is when Metyr changed the form of the Elden Beast to that of the Elden Ring. Something which can be hosted by a vessel which can communicate with the denizens of the order it rules. The first cycle had the order revolve only around the lord. This time by having the order revolve around the god rather than a lord, the nature of conquest in the Lands Between would not be a factor in removing Metyr's power. If a lord was challenged and defeated, then the challenger would just become the new lord keeping the same vessel of the vassal beast in power. In the future, we see that Metyr furthers this ability by directly communicating with denizens of the order with the birth of the Two Fingers. This would mean Metyr would have more power to control and guide whatever order that arises not just through the vessel of the vassal beast and its lord, but through the common denizens as well.\n\nSide-Note: Now after Metyr flees with the now Elden Ring, I believe over time with the Finger Ruins and Two Fingers influences the hornsent to conduct rituals that would allow them to rise to \"sainthood\" and \"godhood\". This eventually results in Gateway of Divinity being able to create a being that would be able to be a vessel for the vassal beast. However, through whatever seduction and betrayal, Marika was able to become the god and thus becomes the new vessel for the Elden Ring.\n\nBefore you go I want to give you one last item description. It is one of the first items in your inventory already equipped. The Memory of Grace Description states:\n\n*The memory of first grace, which once guided bygone Tarnished to the Lands Between.*\n\n*Lose all runes and return to last site of grace visited.*\n\n***It is merely a cycle.***  \n***Stand before the Elden Ring. Become the Elden Lord.***",

During this war she is cursed by the Fell God of the Fire Giants. In return she curses the last Fire Giant to watch over the flame.\n\n* At this point she is unsure what the Curse inflicted upon her is, but upon getting pregnant with Messmer she begins to realize what happened.\n\n* After Messmer's birth she does everything she can to help Messmer, but she can't remove his curse. She can only keep him mostly healthy with the Iris of Grace. \n\n* Her worst fears are realized after the birth of Melina, the Fell Gods curse doesn't really effect her, but all her future children.\n\n* In an attempt to rid herself of the curse, she gathers what she assumes is the curse and casts it from her body. This becomes Radagon, who is born a fully sentient adult. His red hair makes her assume he took the curse for her. Relieved she sends him to go claim Liurnia, wanting to get some use out of him.\n\n* Her hopes that the curse is gone vanishes after Morgott and Mohg are born as Omens.\n\n* News reaches her that Radagon had children with Rennala, and the children were born without any notable curses save sharing his red hair. This causes Marika to become more unhinged. The beginning of her desire to turn away from the Golden Order begins.\n\n* Unbeknownst to Marika, the portion she removed that became Radagon, was also her love/devotion to the Greater Will/Golden Order. She wasn't aware because what she thought was the curse (the red hair) had coalesced around this portion of her psyche. \n\n* She banishes Godfrey and his Tarnished from the Lands Between.\n\n* She sends Messmer to war against the Hornsent.\n\n* She marries Radagon out of jealousy of the non-cursed children he had with Rennala. He agrees due to his complete devotion to the Golden Order which he inherited from Marika.\n\n* Miquella and Malenia are born cursed, this pushes Marika even further to the brink.\n\n* Godwyn is murdered, her only perfect child. Shortly after this she shatters the Elden Ring.",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilp8px",
    "score": 104,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "I noticed when building a personal map of the NPC positions in the Round Table Hold that a disproportionate number of them have names starting with A to G. This combined with \"D\" being the one NPC who stays sitting in the central room the longest had me thinking: what if there is something going on here involving a musical scale?      \n      \n##**Configuration #1**      \n      \nThe room has 8 sides but that actually isn't very useful for a cyclically repeating octave because then one of the letters would be duplicated (A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A). However, including all of the sharps that's twelve tones A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, which could split the room using four walls and 8 corner positions. This fits very well using Corhyn (C), D, Diallos (D#), and Gideon (G#), who are all found within the Round Table Hold room at initial meeting. The only characters found inside the room who do not fit the letter pattern are Roderika (on the F) and the martyred Marika (on the F#). On the other hand, \"Fia\" does start with an \"F\", and she sits beyond the walls in this general area. This reading also places the player character in context on A#.      \n       \nAnother notable observation of this radial reading is that the axe in the table is in between the G# and A positions - neatly dividing between registers of the octave.      \n       \nThe point that I am making is that the chromatic scale has directionality. When it is arranged as a circle with 12 points, that is similar to the face of a clock, and clocks also show time advancing in a predictable clockwise direction. So the Round Table Hold provides clues about where each Tarnished originate from in context of timeline - pre-banishment. In broad strokes, the following history emerges:      \n      \n**A**: Aftermath of the Arrival of the Two Fingers.     \n      \n**A#**: The first Tarnished - likely the Warrior as \"they were all Warriors once\".     \n      \n**C**: Beginning of worship of the Two Fingers, as represented by Corhyn being of the Two Fingers faith and the prophet beginning equipment being the Two Fingers Seal.     \n      \n**C#**: \"See sharp\" - a period of study and investigation. Nepheli Loux is in this general area and \"Loux\" means \"lynx-eyed\" which is related to having sharp enough eyesight to see the Lynx constellation. As she is a parallel for Hoarah Loux, it would seem to indicate this is where his arc begins, under another foster parent with parallels to Gideon.     \n      \n**D**: The heyday of the Eternal Cities Nokron and Nokstella, as shown through \"D\" being split between two characters, one of which is buried in the underground.     \n      \n**D#**: The rise of House Hoslow and the importance of blood lineage. The fall of the Eternal Cities as shown through D\u2019s assassination in a room in this radial direction.     \n      \n**E**: A period of building the legacy of Hoarah Loux/Godfrey. A meeting of Marika and Hoarah Loux as shown through Rodrika's presence in this section and the Godfrey portrait on the wall.      \n       \n**F**: Roderika seems to be first placed here to draw parallel between herself and Fia (F), who represents a different aspect of Marika. Fia is associated with the Baldachin, which is a drapery over a bed resembling the drapes over the Shadowlands. So this is likely also the marker for when the Shadowlands were sealed.     \n       \n**Between F to F#**: An iconoclasm era - records of previous history are tossed out into the fire and burned to ashes, which seems to be embodied in Messmer's campaign. I think that the timeline may get a bit confusing here, in the sense that contained within \u201cF-F#\u201d an entirely new circuit of the Roundtable Hold can be completed which lays out the rise of the demigod offspring of the Golden Order.      \n       \n**F#**: Marika firmly set in stone as goddess of the Lands Between.      \n      \n**Between G to G#**: Again, I think that an entire circuit of the Roundtable Hold could be contained within this phase where Gideon stands in as a proxy for Radagon\u2019s studies at Raya Lucaria. This would involve the rise of the Carian offspring of Ranni, Rykard, Radahn. The death of \u201cD\u201d and Rogier succumbing to deathroot in this case pointing to Godwyn\u2019s assassination and the repeated F# indicating the point when the Elden Ring was Shattered as signified by this particular Marika statue being damaged.      \n      \n**G#**: While in the F to F# era Godfrey\u2019s axe in the table indicated his commitment to being a Lord, in the G to G# era this could indicate the point at which he was exiled in favor of Radagon being elevated to Elden Lord.     \n      \n**Between G# to A**: Another circuit of the table and a good fit for the dividing of Great Runes from the Shattered ring and the rise and fall of the last set of demigods being Malenia and Miquella, considering the general association between the Two Fingers and Great Runes.     \n       \n**A &amp; B (averaging to A#)**: The Tarnished represented by the player are called to the Lands Between. Doubly significant with the implication that the character selection of body type \"A\" and \"B\" has an internally consistent meaning.     \n      \n##**Configuration #2**\n      \nWhat about the other characters who are outside of the room? A# and E are opposites of the chromatic scale, and the plan layout of the building is such that Alberich at the entrance on the ground floor is directly opposite from Enia in the Two Fingers room. A few other points can be picked up along the way - \"Crepus's\" (C) Black Key Crossbow is found on the ground floor in the area below Hewg and Fia, under one of the ascending staircases. Gideon in his study again on a G# is the end of the line. So this reading seems to represent Gideon's character arc from initially joining the Roundtable Hold to becoming the scholarly leader that he is today. From a taunting youth getting into bloody brawls to an assassin of the Two Fingers to becoming an aged authority figure. Though she appears not at all in the round table hold, Dolores the Sleeping Arrow is noted in Gideon's backstory and the \"D\" in this setup lands on the Marika statue. Enia calls him \"young Gideon\", implying that her role was as a mentor character on his path before he rejected the Two Fingers and took up his own studies.      \n      \n##**Configuration #3**     \n      \nThere are two chromatic-named characters unaccounted for: Ensha and Dungeater. Ensha is also an oddity in that he is narrowly visible in the distance down the corridor while standing in the centre of the table. And a few notable features could be expanded upon, including Rogier's position on the balcony behind Diallos, the Twin Maiden Husks being behind the wall in the direction where D is looking, and Nepheli's position in the same room as Ensha. The first two readings of the space converged on Gideon, and this last one is also designed to give information related to Gideon.      \n      \nThree points to be aware of: 1) The axe in the Round Table Hold indicates the ending of one phase and the start of another, 2) \"Ensha\" is an anagram of \"Ashen\", 3) If the first reading is the progression of a historical record in a clockwise direction, then reversing to an anti-clockwise direction would be researching the past.      \n      \nSo Gideon starts with some Ashen remains. One step backwards and there is a representation of Marika, whose Will is the object of Gideon's study. Before the next step backwards, there is the fire which obliterated information by burning it to ashes.     \n      \nDigging back into the past re-contextualizes some things by seeing them with fresh eyes (C#, \"see sharp\"). Like, the *Rusted Anchor* description implies that the Misbegotten are what became of Tarnished who never left the Lands Between on the ships with Godfrey, they lingered and degraded over time. Hewg is one such Misbegotten. Also in this region is where Roderika sets up her spirit *tuning* operation - which both directly alludes to the musical theme of the history and shows a knack for understanding how to analyze the old spirit ashes. Roderika can hear the wailing spirit of the Dungeater as a parallel to Marika being cursed with new insight about past crusades weighing on her mind. Dig back even further and Rogier re-discovers the old infestation of deathroot (D) like a pathogen emerging from thawing permafrost.      \n       \n&gt; \"Spirit tuning is not merely the simple act of imbuing strength. It is an art that lies somewhere between tuning an instrument and conducting a conversation, leaving both parties enriched.\"      \n- *Ghost Glovewort* description    \n      \nThe corruption storyline gets even stronger as the \"Dungeater\" (D#) digs deeper into the past and convinces himself that prior civilizations such as the horned Omen were more enlightened and should be emulated. The Twin Maiden husks are also in this area, where they resemble the mummified remains such as would have been taken from Egyptian tombs. In real history, it was up to the 1700's that Egyptomania had people grinding mummies (and forgeries from more recently executed criminals) into dust and [eating it for \"health benefits\"](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mumia-the-strange-history-of-human-remains-as-medicine#A-liquament-of-carcases) or turning it into pigment. Pseudo-science and pseudo-archaeology make wildly inaccurate claims and degrade trust in observable reality.     \n       \nAnd then this research into the past concludes with \"Ensha\". The *Royal Remains* armour set includes bones studded with gemstones in a manner that is reminiscent of the [Catacomb Saints of 16th and 17th century Catholicism](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/meet-the-fantastically-bejeweled-skeletons-of-catholicisms-forgotten-martyrs-284882/). Essentially what happened is that some people in the 1500's stumbled on a Roman catacomb dating to the 3rd century and the Catholic Church declared that all of the bones were holy relics belonging to martyrs, regardless of who they actually belonged to. Literally, they couldn't know whose bones were in the mix - they just wanted more holy relics to inspire the faithful.      \n      \n&gt; \"It is said that the bones belong to an ancient lord - the soulless king. The lord of the lost and desperate, who was known as Ensha.\"     \n       \nThe state of Ensha seems to be an indicator that while Gideon has gone through the motions of excavating the past, he has done a crude job of interpretation. This is and has always been a game about discovering Marika's motive for Shattering the Elden Ring - and Gideon doesn't have the full picture. Where did the Twin Maiden husks come from? Where were the bones of Ensha found? These items are taken out of their original archaeological context, making it much more difficult to understand their significance.     \n      \n##**Matching with 12-step Astrology**\n\nThe \"D\" and \"D#\" provide some fixed points. D, Hunter of Death and his brother, being gold and silver entwined is reminiscent of Gemini in the Western Zodiac as a representation of twins Castor and Pollux (sons of Leda of Greek mythology). And also of the Vedic astrology that Gemini having the planet ruler of Mercury gives it associations of communication between the surface and underworld due to the god Mercury's role as messenger. Working backwards from this to \"C\" the story of Aries in the Western Zodiac is that of the search for the Golden Fleece.     \n     \nOn the D# there is Rogier suffering from an infestation of deathroot. The crabs in the Lands Between are especially afflicted with deathroot corruption. The disease \"cancer\" was named after the Greek for \"crab\", same as the zodiac sign.     \n      \nThen on E there is Godfrey who defeated a lion and wears it on his back. The Zodiac story of Leo is that of the Nemean Lion who Heracles defeated as one of the 12 labours he was required to complete, and afterwards wore it's pelt on his back.    \n     \nAfter establishing calibration other points can be found, such as the Scorpions of Rauh pre-existing the Hornsent (likely themselves of Capricorn and/or Taurus).     \n      \nIt is one of the subplots of the Lands Between that ruin lies at the end of the procession of stars - because \"what goes around comes around\". If it's an inescapable cycle then *the same* ruin will happen again and again like clockwork. The main Lands Between offers ways to escape the cycle. The Shadowlands is stuck repeating it.     \n      \n&gt; \"Onze, a master swordsman who devoted himself to the Star-Lined Sword, realized that only ruin awaited at the end of the procession of stars, and imprisoned himself in order to forestall it.\"     \n- *Ashes of Demi-Human Swordsman Yoshi*     \n      \n##**What about the Round Table Itself?**      \n      \nAs has been observed previously, there are several swords embedded in the table - to be exact there are 6 flamberges, 4 straight swords, and 1 axe. This sums to 11 which is 1 less than 12. It has been noted previously that maybe there is a missing 12th sword immediately to the left of the axe (at the \"A\" position) based on the grooves in the table. But on the other hand there are at least 2 other locations with grooves that do not correspond to swords (at B and C#), and the sword immediately to the right of the axe is embedded in the table at an odd angle that does not match any others or any groove (though it does point directly at Gideon's start position). There is potential for additional useful information here, but I don't know what it is at this time.      \n      \nHowever, again I am not the first person to connect the Round Table with astrology. As was pointed out to me by u/quirkus, there is a history of the Round Table being [associated with the zodiac](https://milky-way-astrology.blogspot.com/2020/05/astrological-correspondences-for.html), and there is a history with the [12 signs of the zodiac being associated with alchemy](https://meaningfulmoon.com/alchemy-and-the-zodiac-unlocking-the-secrets-of-the-cosmos/). For the first I do not know what the primary source is and following up on the second is something that I do not want to get into. On the other hand, there is a documented example of a [Round Table last painted in the 1500's by order of King Henry VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table) which includes 24 names of knights + King Arthur - where 24 is a multiple of 12.     \n      \nIn fact, FromSoftware has alluded to a connection between zodiac and the Round Table before. In Armored Core V there is a faction called the \"Zodiac\" and many of their AC units have head part names associated with Arthurian legend:      \n      \nNo. 1: Capricornus - Tristan     \nNo. 2: Aquarius - Lancelot     \nNo. 6: Gemini (2nd version) - Arthur     \nNo. 8: Leo - Galahad     \nNo. 9: Virgo - Gawain     \n      \nAll of the above names are found on the Winchester Table. Galahad is notably one of 3 knights to have achieved the grail. And two more of note for Elden Ring in particular: Sir Hector de Marais (younger half-brother of Lancelot), and Sir Lionel (cousin of Sir Hector de Marais and brother of Bors the Younger - another knight of the table who also achieved the grail).      \n       \n##**Trapped inside this Octavarium**     \n       \nAnd I thought this was all pretty neat. But as it turns out there is also precedent for a theming constructed around the musical octave. In 2005 the progressive rock band Dream Theatre released their eighth studio album \"Octavarium\", in which the 8 songs on the album progress through a musical octave from \"F\" to \"F\". The lyrics and album art are dense with symbolism and pop culture scavenger hunts.     \n      \n*\"I never wanted to become someone like him     \nSo secure content to live each day just like the last     \nI was sure I knew that this was not for me...*      \n       \n*...As far as I could tell     \nThere's nothing more I need     \nBut still I ask myself     \nCould this be everything?      \nThen all I swore     \nThat I would never be was now     \nSo suddenly     \nThe only thing     \nI wanted      \nTo become     \nTo be someone just like him...*      \n       \n*...We move in circles      \nBalanced all the while      \nOn a gleaming razor's edge     \nA perfect sphere     \nColliding with our fate     \nThis story ends where it began\"*     \n- \"Octavarium\" from Octavarium (2005) by Dream Theatre.     \n      \nI think that is essentially what has happened with Gideon - in his efforts to look backwards for answers on how to proceed in a post-Shattering world he has become trapped in circular logic. This is why he concludes that Marika's will is that the Tarnished should struggle forever.     \n      \nAnd also it seems that very literally the Lands Between is haunted by the \"Music of the Spheres\". In any case, there are comically large metal spheres similar to the cover art for \"Octavarium\" found in Caelid, Nokron, Nokstella, and Raya Lucaria.     \n      \nIt also doesn't hurt that the album artwork for the song \"Octavarium\" is an 8-sided room similar to the central room of the Round Table Hold, where the main point of entry/exit (the one that leads to the stairs in the Round Table Hold, anyways) is on the \"E\".",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mltn6i",
    "score": 91,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "First of all, for the ones who didn't read the previous post, some things won't be mentioned again, here you have it:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/s/YQeZj9kQXN\n\nNow that we\u2019re up to speed, we can continue. We\u2019ll start from the beginning, and I\u2019ll explain how I think the story\u2019s timeline plays out, giving my reasoning along the way.\n\nFirst of all, we have the Highlanders. What do we know about them? Let\u2019s start with the descriptions of the items related to them:\n\nHighland axe:\n\"Single-sided axe used by the warriors of the highlands. Brave combatants begin battle by crying out their names. Roars are enhanced by this weapon.\"\n\nLeather headband:\n\"Headband worn by highland warriors, made of woven leather. The white favor represents their home settlement.\nHighland warriors are known to be hunters of bears; to them, there is no act more glorious than the subjugation of a savage beast.\"\n\nGloried attire:\n\"Traditional garb of highland warriors, made from woven fabric and finished with fur.\nThis garment is made from fabrics with both blue and red patterns. Red-patterned fabrics were allowed only to those who hunted bears\u2014the greatest and most glorious of the highlanders.\"\n\nLeather arm wraps:\n\"Arm wraps worn by highland warriors, made of sturdy leather and fastened with winding straps. Highland warriors are known to be hunters of bears; to them, there is no act more glorious than the subjugation of a savage beast.\"\n\n\nAs we can see, these warriors were beast hunters, and their culture revolved around the honor of defeating wild animals\u2014especially rune bears.\nBy defeating one of the great red rune bears, we discover this incantation:\n\nRoar of Rugalea:\n*\"Incantation of what is jokingly called 'the bear communion.'\nChannels the power of Rugalea, the great red bear.\nTransform oneself into a great red bear and emit a mighty roar.\nCharging increases potency.\n\nAn incantation that is more akin to the divine invocation of the hornsent than it is to the Dragon Communion.\nOnly through desperate battle with the feral wild can one discover a god unique to oneself.\"*\n\nIt\u2019s very likely that the Highlanders fought against similar beasts in the past, and in this way\u2014just like us\u2014they may have been able to channel the beast\u2019s power upon defeating it. But that\u2019s not all. Pay attention to this phrase: \"An incantation that is more akin to the divine invocation of the hornsent than it is to the Dragon Communion. Only through desperate battle with the feral wild can one discover a god unique to oneself.\"\nIt seems that this type of magic is similar to a divine invocation. Not only that\u2014near the place where we find the Highlander armor, we also find this:\n\nDivine bird warrior Ornis:\n*\"Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell.\nUse to summon the spirit of Ornis the divine bird warrior.\nSpirit of the divine bird warrior from whom the horned warriors claim descent.\nClad in golden armor, and granted wings and feathers by divine invocation. Ornis succeeded in taming the divine bird and made its wings his own as he soared through the sky.\nWhen he finally fell to earth, he lived on as the guardian deity of the temple quarter.\"*\n\nJust like the Highlanders, Ornis managed to defeat a great beast and obtain its power. Furthermore, the horned warriors claim to descend from him, so Ornis belongs to a time before the horned warriors even existed. The proximity of the Highlander set and these ashes makes me think the Highlanders could be the ancestors of the hornsent. One thing I haven\u2019t mentioned yet is the Leather headband description\u2014it says the Highlanders have a home settlement (settlement: a place, typically one which has previously been uninhabited, where people establish a community). This could be the origin of Belurat, the Tower Settlement. As I mentioned in the previous post, the Beast Claw resembles the attacks of both a rune bear and Godfrey, and it imitates the techniques of the tower folk. The fact that the Highland Axe enhances roars shows how the Highlanders were connected to the Crucible too.\n\nFinally, I think the Kaiden Sellswords also descend from the Highlanders. The helms of both sets are identical, and in the Tel Handed Talisman we can see a hornsent wielding a Dismounter. In summary, I believe the links between the Highlanders and the hornsent are strong enough to suggest that one group descended from the other.\n\n\nLet\u2019s continue with how I think the timeline works (I\u2019ll skip some parts, focusing only on the topic at hand):\n\n1. \u201cThe Seduction and the Betrayal\u201d happens, and Marika ascends to godhood.\n\n\n2. The Erdtree is created, Godfrey receives the sap, and the Age of the Erdtree begins with the war against the Fire Giants (the sword monument mentions this).\n\n\n3. Liurnia and the House of the Erdtree are united, and the rest of the Lands Between are conquered by Godfrey.\n\nWe know this because Rellana followed Messmer, and because of Messmer\u2019s connection to Radahn.\n\n4. Godfrey and his warriors become Tarnished and are exiled from the Lands Between.\n\nWe know this because Messmer knows what a Tarnished is, so the crusade must have happened afterward.\n\n5. Radagon becomes Elden Lord and establishes the Golden Order.\n\nWe know this for several reasons:\nThe designs of the seals and their descriptions:\n\n-Erdtree Seal: \"Formless sacred seal decorated with an Erdtree crest, once the focus of religion in the Lands Between. Even though the Elden Ring is shattered, and the Erdtree has dulled from its former radiance, earnest faith continues to hold the answers.\"\n\n-Golden Order Seal: \"Formless sacred seal depicting the ceremonial observation of Order. Enhances Golden Order Fundamentalist incantations. Fundamentalism is scholarship in all but name. Scales incantations using both Intelligence and Faith.\"\n\nWe know that the philosophy of combining Intelligence and Faith began with Radagon.\n\n-Radagon Icon: \"A legendary talisman depicting the Elden Lord Radagon. Shortens the casting time of sorceries and incantations. As the husband of Rennala of Caria, the red-haired Radagon studied sorcery, and as the husband of Queen Marika, he studied incantations. Thus did the hero aspire to be complete.\"\n\nDuring the crusade, the black knights even used weapons and shields with the symbol of the Elden Ring instead of the Erdtree.\n\n6. Messmer carries out his crusade and removes the evidence linking the Golden Order to its past, thus rewriting its history.\n\nWe know this due to several factors\u2014let\u2019s start with the soldiers. All of them, even the most basic ones, can use stomps and other Crucible-related attacks. The crusade was used by Marika as a way to get rid of much of the Crucible-related forces. She also took the opportunity to hide her son, erasing his ties to serpents and fire.\n\nWe know that Godfrey\u2019s Age of Plenty had already ended long before the events of the game (the Erdtree is but an object of faith), so Marika had plenty of time to rewrite history.\n\nFinally, I want to talk about the Seduction and the Betrayal.\nThis is my theory: I believe Marika managed to ascend to divinity by seducing the hornsent with the power they desired.\n\nIn other posts, I\u2019ve discussed the connection between horned beings and spirits. Omens summon spirits, sculpted keepers can serve as vessels for the divine beast, Mohg\u2019s body can be used as a vessel for Radahn\u2019s soul\u2026\n\nLet's see the Secret Rite Scroll:\n\"A scroll made of white tree bark. Few can decipher the scroll, which describes the secret rite of the divine gateway said to be found at the tower enshrouded by shadow.\n'A lord will usher in a god's return, and the lord's soul will require a vessel.'\"\n\nI believe that in this ritual, Marika became a god, and Godfrey\u2014using his hornsent ancestry (his affinity with spirits)\u2014used his body as the vessel for the soul of Serosh, the Lord of Beasts.\n\nBut I also think this is when Marika committed the Original Sin.\nIn the trailer, we can see her taking golden threads from a sort of white sack and using them to open the gate.\n\nIn Enir-Ilim, we find statues of two people\u2014one larger (male) and one smaller (female)\u2014inside a sack, with spiral-shaped horns wrapping around them. I believe this was part of the original ritual: the two bodies were supposed to merge at the moment of ascension. I think the figures in the statue ultimately became Marika (light) and Radagon (darkness), but instead of letting the ritual happen naturally, Marika stole the runes (the soul) of Radagon and used them to open the door. In doing so, she ended up absorbing Radagon\u2019s soul, making him her other half.\n\nAnd why does Grandam call Marika a \u201cwanton strumpet\u201d? Well\u2026 we know Messmer is Marika\u2019s son, and that he\u2019s older than Radahn, so he must have been born during Godfrey\u2019s reign. The problem is that his butterfly motif and red hair betray him as Radagon\u2019s son.\n\nSo yes\u2014basically, Marika was unfaithful to Godfrey with Radagon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Hello everyone, this post has a simple purpose: I saw many people praise the timeline proposed by Tarnished Archeologist in his video \"The 3 creeds of the Erdtree\" ([https://youtu.be/6MNPMmL6N3g](https://youtu.be/6MNPMmL6N3g)) so I want to explain why I think it\u2019s totally wrong. First of all, what does his timeline say in short?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dkal2stux4fb1.jpg?width=1520&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=526fdb2398120744cf86be8913715480eb52141a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zt41kjvtx4fb1.jpg?width=1520&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21d0a3f7e75cbddeb01a2998ebcf0fee3aeacb84\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4h58stsx4fb1.jpg?width=1520&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39720e2a2eddaf4d803f3366336409651e34b7ab\n\n* The Greater Will sends a golden star bearing the Elden Ring  \n \n* Giants defeated  \n \n* The Erdtree stars to wither  \n \n* The Erdtree is burned for the first time  \n \n* The Erdtree becomes a golden illusion  \n \n* The Elden Ring is shattered  \n \n* War against the ancient dragons, Godwyn creates the dragon cult  \n \n* Liurnian wars and Radagon weds Rennala  \n \n* Godfrey is exiled and Radagon becomes Elden Lord  \n \n* The Rune of Death is removed from the Elden Ring and the Golden Order is created  \n \n\nNow, let's start our analysis:\n\n**The Golden Order created after the shattering?**\n\nThe Rune of Death, also called Destined Death, is one of the Great Runes that make the Elden Ring and was removed by Queen Marika, marking the beginning of the Golden Order (*\"The Golden Order was created by confining Destined Death\" - mending rune of the Death Prince*). TA however claims that the rune was removed after Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and it makes very little sense: the Elden Ring is the tool sent by the Greater Will via the golden meteor that the god in charge, in this case Marika, uses for controlling the order of the world and establish a new age, so how do you impose your Golden Order with a broken tool? And how do you remove a piece from an object if said object is already smashed to the ground in pieces? An empyrean becomes a god only if they obtain the Elden Ring and the power to control the world, so it would be pretty dumb for Marika to destroy the origin of her powers. Furthermore an article written on the official website of the game ([https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/look-the-history-of-elden-rings-lands-between-the-age-of-gods](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/look-the-history-of-elden-rings-lands-between-the-age-of-gods) ) says that *\u201cthe Elden Ring was somehow shattered, and the order of the world broke with it\u201d* implying that there can\u2019t be any Order without the Elden Ring. \n\n**Marika and Radagon doing things after the Elden Ring's shattering?**\n\nThis timeine says that many things happened after Marika smashed the Ring, but do you remember what actually happened? Enia says that *\u201cQueen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision. A god, in truth. But after the Elden Ring\u2019 s shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree. A grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood\u201d* (notice that she **shattered the Order**, again meaning that the Elden Ring is the concept Order itself and you cannot establish anything without it and that there was in fact an Order when the Ring was destroyed). The Greater Will didn\u2019t tolerate this trespass and imprisoned her in the Erdtree with her other self Radagon, as the intro of the game says she was \u201cnowhere to be found\u201d, so it\u2019s kinda impossible that after destroying the order of the world Marika/Radagon were able to create the Golden Order, fight against the dragons and the Carians, marry with Rennala, have kids, divorce, exile Godfrey, marry togheter and have twins while being crucified for eternity, and it makes no sense too that the Greater Will just waited and imprisoned them after all that time, therefore all of the things I listed before must have happened BEFORE the shattering.\n\n**Godwyn doing things...after his death?**\n\nThis is the most absurd thing of this timeline: according to TA Godwyn created the dragon cult after the shattering of the Elden Ring...the problem is that Godwyn was already dead when the Ring was destroyed, and I really don\u2019t think that a soulless fish corpse can fight in a war and create a new religion. This is confirmed in game by Rogier who says *\u201cSomeone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden. That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. And it became a catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.\u201d*, the official website of the game says the same: *\u201cAfter his* (Godwyn\u2019s) *death, the Elden Ring was somehow shattered, and the order of the world broke with it\u201d* (*[*https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/look-the-history-of-elden-rings-lands-between-the-age-of-gods*](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/look-the-history-of-elden-rings-lands-between-the-age-of-gods)*) and so does Ranni in the story trailer \u201cOn a night of  wint\u2019ry fog. The Rune of Death was stolen and the demigods began to fall. Starting with Godwyn the Golden. Queen Marika was driven to the brik (and Shattered the Elden Ring)*\u201d.* This means that the correct order of events is this: war against the dragons \u2192 Night of the Black Knives \u2192 Godwyn\u2019s death \u2192 Marika shatters the Elden Ring.\n\n**On the removal of Destined Death**\n\nAs we already said the Golden Order was founded when the Rune of Death was removed from the Elden Ring BEFORE it was shattered, and now we have another proof: we know that after removing it Marika entrusted the rune to Maliketh and later Ranni stole a fragment of it to imbue the daggers of the Black Knives with its deadly power to kill Godwyn, so this means that the rune was removed and sealed away before his death, which definetely happened before the shattering as we have just established.\n\n**Actually, the Golden Order was already there**\n\nTA claims that the Golden Order was created after the Liurnian wars, but this dialogue by Rogier says the contrary (he\u2019s talking about the ashes of war he sells): *\u201cThey were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle. In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I\u2019m told.\u201d* this means that before the two wars the Golden Order was already established, or it wouldn\u2019t make sense for the Academy to have different principles from the Golden Order if it wasn\u2019t already a thing.\n\n**Erdtree burial without the Erdtree?**\n\nAnother important thing that was created along the Golden Order is the practice of Erdtree burial. Basically the most worthy were buried in the catacombs at the roots of the Erdtree so that their bodies could be absorbed by the Erdtree and their spirits could reincarnate into a new body. When we arrive in the Lands Between however, we discover that this process does not work anymore, and nobody can return to the Erdtree. In fact in the catacombs we can see corpses unable to be absorbed by the roots, we can collect ashes of great heroes like dragon knight Kristoff even if they were granted the honor of this burial and we see ghosts roaming the Lands Between, as Ranni says they are *\u201cash unreturned to the Erdtree\u201d.* The explanation for this is probably the fact that the Erdtree is now disconnected from its own roots *\u201cthe roots ot the Greattree were once linked to those of the Erdtree \u2013 root resin\u201d* and since the Erdtree is closely linked to the Elden Ring I think this happened when it was shattered. Anyway, the fact that right now with the Elden Ring shattered this process doesn\u2019t work shows that it would\u2019t make sense for Marika to create Erdtree Burial after destroying the Order of the world, as said before without the power of the Elden Ring you can\u2019t do anything.\n\n**Lastly, the first burning of the Erdtree is much more simple of what you think**\n\nAnother important point in TA\u2019s timeline that I want to disprove is the so called first burning of the Erdtree. In Leyndell we find the streets covered in ash, and considering what happens when we burn the Erdtree this must have come from the Erdtree too right? Right, but it doesn\u2019t come from the burning theorized by TA, it has a much more simpler explanation. From the description of Bernahl\u2019s armor set: *\u201cSilver armor engraved with tiny beasts. Worn by Bernahl the Recusant. Beasts are drawn to champions, and to lords. And this armor befits a champion worthy of becoming a lord. And that is what Bernahl was.* ***Until his maiden threw  herself into the fire.****\u201d* His finger maiden threw herself into the fire, and not some random fire, but the forge of the giants just like Melina does for us and just like Vyke\u2019s maiden was supposed to do before he decided to inherit the Frenzied Flame to save her. If you are not convinced , Sekiro Dubi even discovered a cut questline involving this finger maiden ([https://youtu.be/sqaq6iZZ9Wg](https://youtu.be/sqaq6iZZ9Wg) ) and in one of her dialogues she says *\u201cHere, can you see it? The red flames smoldering even now? Burned by this, I became your kindling at last. So, please, sacrifice me the moment you walk toward Destined Death\u201d.* She burned herself over and over in hope to become kindling for the forge, but in the end her sacrifice was in vain and Bernahl lost his faith in the word of the Two Fingers and joined the recusants. Judging by the ash in the capital she was able to only partially burn the Erdtree, maybe because the only one who can do it properly is Melina, the kindling maiden. Anyway, I think that this is a much more coherent explanation supported by the game itself.\n\nWith all these informations we can make a new timeline:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \tThe Greater Will sends a golden star bearing the elden ring  \n \n* \tGiants defeated  \n \n* \tDestined Death is removed from the Elden Ring and the Golden Order \tis born  \n \n* \tLiurnian wars, Radagon and Rennala weds  \n \n* \tWar against the ancient dragons, Godwyn creates the dragon cult  \n \n* \tGodfrey is exiled, Radagon becomes Elden Lord  \n \n* \tNight of the Black Knives and Godwyn\u2019s death  \n \n* \tMarika shatters the Elden Ring  \n \n* \tShattering war, the demigods fight  \n \n* \tThe Tarnished return and Bernahl sacrifice his maiden in vain  \n \n\nThanks for reading! Let me know what you think. Edit: grammar and spelling",

    "body": "We as a community have believed almost unquestionably that the Ancient Dynasty was formed by a group of people migrating over ships, as it's been depicted in the Dynasty Obelisk. Finding these ships nicknamed Stone Coffins in the Cerulean Coast only strengthened this belief. But i want to challenge it. I believe i have found evidence the ships were not the origins of the Dynasty but were pulled here by them. The Obelisks doesn't depict the origin of the Dynasty but rather only a big event in their history.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oiauisjt99id1.png?width=3306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88372ec64c75e4b3c24597fd3b92b2f92dec0f4c\n\n# The Pillar\n\n&gt;*The very center of the Lands Between. All manners of Death* ***wash up here***, *only to be suppressed*\n\nThe Pillar of Suppression is a structure that many wrongfully attribute to Marika sealing death. There is direct architectural evidence that shows the Pillar was built by the Ancient Dynasty, sharing in many of their designs. This evidence was nicely compiled by u/[npcompl33t](https://www.reddit.com/user/npcompl33t/) so credit to them for these images. Like their post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1dqs4he/the_suppression_tower_was_built_by_uhl/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0o8cwmnba9id1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ffc7e2b14983db93bb47390e42069dfba9e4f49\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rj8858lca9id1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8318af97e95728f3f063daabed0b2087e766308\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwth4z7fa9id1.jpg?width=862&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=371b089b0798730d31de96e148504282dc4b99e6\n\nThe Pillar is thus much older than Marika and i believe older than the Hornsent, as the Dynasty seems older than them.\n\n# Death Watchers\n\nThe direct result of the Pillar's influence is the Spirit Graves. This is reinforced again and again by the items related to the Gravebirds.\n\n&gt;**Gravebird Helm** - *Gravebirds are ancient golems, created to guard the spiritgraves built where all manners of Death ultimately* ***drift***.\n\n&gt;**Rings of Spectral Light -** *Sorcery practiced by the keepers of the spiritgraves, where all death ultimately* ***drifts.***\n\nThe Pillar states *All manners of Death* ***wash up here***.\n\n&gt;Wash Up - 1) To carry (an object) to land. 2) To be carried by water to land.\n\nWash Up is synonym to Drift. Death **drifts** here because of the Pillar. The Gravebird items directly state this. The Spiritgraves exist because of the Suppression pillar.\n\n# Stone Coffins\n\n&gt;**Map: Southern Shore -** *Map of the southern shore of the Gravesite Plain. A captivating vista of brilliant blue flowers, intermingled with colossal stone coffins of unknown origin that* ***seemingly drifted to this place.***\n\n&gt;**Congealed Putrescence** - *Found underground in the land to where* ***stone coffins drift.***\n\nThe Suppression Pillar was built by the Ancient Dynasty, as it has their symbols on it. They have Obelisks which depict the Stone Coffins found in Cerulean Coast. The Pillar states Death washes up in the Gravesite Plain, and Gravebirds were built to watch over this land, where death drifts. The Stone Coffins seem to have drifted here.\n\nThey're ships. But they're also coffins. Full of Death. The Stone Coffins were dragged here unintentionally by the Ancient Dynasty, this event is depicted on their Obelisks. That's how the numen's ancestors got here, by mistake.\n\n# Ghostflame that ties it\n\nIf the Stone Coffins were brought here by force by a civilization which worshiped Deathbirds, then the logicl conclusion is that they'd offer this alien flesh to be burned like the rest in the ghostflame kilns. Why else would Death in all forms be dragged to this singular region and suppressed, if not to serve the Deathbirds, who the Gravebirds were built to be companions to?\n\nWell, wouldn't you know it.\n\n&gt;**Mass of Putrescence** - *Sorcery originating from the putrid liquor of the stone coffins. In an age long past, Death was burned by ghostflame. Even the remains of tainted flesh were given equal treatment in death.*\n\nThis is the era in which Deathbirds ruled, the era before the Erdtree where Death was Burned in Ghostflame. Death dragged by force through the Suppression Pillar. Who one day brought the Stone Coffins as well, and the servants of Deathbirds, the gravekeepers of the Ancient Dynasty, burned the tainted flesh of the coffins in the flame like any other.\n\n# Final Thoughts - Putrescence and artificial Life, Gravity and Dynasty\n\nNow comes the part of less evidence and more speculation and i will keep things brief as i want the main point of this post to be the new timeline theory of the Dynasty.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zv8kb4h9g9id1.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2679753fd63459cd2da8dd09a7988131da33a0b\n\n\"Impure lives\" is a strange term only used to describe Albinaurics and the Stone Coffin flesh. The Putrescence looks very similar to Silver Tear husks. Piquebone Arrows and Alluring Pots both lure enemies with an aggravating shadow, one using Putrescence and one using Albinauric Bloodclot. The Claymen of the Dynasty use bubble sorcery which when used by us creates the same symbol as the Sellian/Eternal City magic. The claymen are also... well, men made of clay, they break into piles of mud on death. Could say they're primitive artificial life. Could see how the Dynasty used Putrescence to build claymen and the practice was refined over time by the Nox. I mean Putrescent Knight has disintegrating legs both the rider and the horse, like Albinaurics.\n\nStone Coffins are guarded by the Stone Ball enemies who use gravity magic to function. A stone ship with no sails working on gravity magic makes sense. The Dynasty ruins are one of the few places we find Malformed Stars (wingless Astels) and the Claymen use harpoons with gravity-infused meteor shards. There is strong ties between Gravity Magic and the Dynasty.",

But through countless victories in war, it became the embodiment of Order.\" - Protection of the Erdtree\n\nShe earned her order after many battles, so \"Golden Order\" did not exist from the beginning.\n\nThe warriors who participated in the war against the giants were called the \"champions of the Erdtree\" ( Golden Order is never mentioned ) but besides that...\n\n\"Thought to have been used to hone the weapons of the champions of the War against the Giants at the birth of the Erdtree.\" - Smithing Stone 7\n\n...Erdtre was still something small (Not that it was small, it was just that it was still something very recent, it had just been created)\n\nAnother thing that makes me believe that the Golden Order was created after the war against the giants is Marika's Echo from that part.\n\n\"\"Put the giants to the sword\nand confine the flame atop the mount.\n\nLet a new epoch begin.\nAn epoch glistening with life.\n\nBrandish the Elden Ring,\nfor the Age of the Erdtree!\"\"\n\nHere she is emphasizing that her Age will really begin after the extermination of the giants.(it becomes even clearer in Japanese)\n\nAnd from the description of Black Monk Amon ashes it can be said that Gloam Eyed Queen was still present before or during the war against the giants since her black flames were still influential and still had the ability to slay gods.\n\nSo the timeline for now is \n\n(Birth of Erdtree &gt;&gt; War against the giants &gt;&gt; End of the Gloam Eyed Queen/Creation of the Golden Order.)\n\nThe events that come after this are diverse, but it is here that we have the first mention of Radagon with his red hair and after that his first important appearance as \"champion of the GOLDEN ORDER\" (only now it's mentioned) in the Liurnian wars.\n\nThanks for reading if you got here, I did my best to make the pieces make some sense, I hate getting involved with timeline because my head always hurts.

    "body": "Originally this was just going to be a reply to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1gbxidl/marika_never_abandoned_messmer/), but (probably because I ended up writing like 5 pages) I couldn't post it as a simple comment. I think a lot of that post gets the timeline right, and while I have major disagreements (mainly on the stuff regarding Marika and Messmer) I don't intend this to be targeted at OP, but I want it to be clear that some points might be raised specifically because I'm refuting arguments made there. In light of that, I've reworked my reply to broadly lay out a timeline for the Crusade, while also addressing the actions, beliefs, and motivations of the characters involved and how they inform us about the timeline.\n\n# Crusade: When, What, Why\n\nTo begin with, let's look at when the Crusade started. As pointed out in the other post, Gaius' remembrance gives us a good headstart:\n\n\"*Both were as elder brothers to the lion, and both were cursed from birth.* \n\n*In spite of, or perhaps because of this very reason, Gaius was both Messmer's friend and the leader of his men.\" -* **Remembrance of the Wild Boar Rider**\n\nAs both Messmer were as elder brothers to Radahn, the Crusade had to occur after Radahn's birth, i.e. during or after Radagon's marriage to Rennala. Our answer to \"during or after\" comes to us from Rellana's helm:\n\n\"*Rennala, head of the royal family of Caria, was said to have given her younger sister, who renounced her lineage to chase after Messmer, a gift of lustrous black hair.*\" - **Rellana's Helm**\n\nIf Rennala gave Rellana a gift when she left to chase Messmer, Rennala must have still been in her right mind at the time of the Crusade. As such, she and Radagon were still married. I believe this point will be strengthened later, but for now, you might be thinking, \"Couldn't Rellana have renounced her birthright to chase after Messmer *before* the Crusade?\" My initial response would be that, while possible, it seems unlikely. Why would Rellana, a member of the Carians, renounce her birthright to marry Messmer, a member of the Erdtree's family line? If anything, that should be a boon to both parties. But reading her helm in light of another description gives provides further insight:\n\n\"*Each and every knight hailed from a renowned family of the Erdtree's upper echelons, but were shunned and chased from their homes after pledging allegiance to Messmer as their master.*\" - **Fire Knight Helm**\n\n[Birds of a feather flock to Messmer](https://preview.redd.it/21ja08dd50xd1.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20a9bace7823ac8e1a8389233d7f6c57daad70e8)\n\nWe learn that the Fire Knights were similarly of noble birth, yet lost their birthright (in their case, less voluntarily) for following Messmer. I believe the most natural way to interpret this is that the Fire Knight's being shunned, and Rellana's renouncing her birthright, were both the same action. And these were both in response to the Crusade. So what was it about the Crusade, and Messmer, that made going on it so negative? Well, that answer comes from a few sources:\n\n\"*Helm worn by soldiers who serve Messmer the Impaler. The iron helm features a visor. Though the engraving upon the forehead is a Scadutree design, it is etched in gold.* ***A small consolation to those forced to wage a war without grace or honor****.*\" - **Messmer Soldier Helm**\n\nThe soldiers in Messmer's army were *forced* to wage this war. So who in the population might be forced into this?\n\n\"*Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell.*\n\n*Use to summon the spirits of two of Messmer's soldiers.*\n\n***These soldiers belonged to the ignoble penal battalion,*** *and were buried hidden from the Scadutree's sight.\" -* **Messmer Soldier Ashes**\n\nNow, I will fully grant that the ashes may simply be saying that *these particular* soldiers were part of a penal battalion, and not all of Messmer's soldiers were prisoners. However, I think the context of them having been forced into battle makes sense. While it may not be the case that all of Messmer's soldiers are prisoners, I believe they are all in some way undesirables. Prisoners, sinners, etc. They are sent on the Crusade, forced to wage war, as an act of penance. I believe this explanation not only provides an understanding of why the Crusaders were scorned despite Marika ordering the Crusade, but also gives some insight into other things within the DLC. Firstly, let's look at Andreas:\n\n\"*Though he remained a devout follower of Messmer after his flight from the Erdtree, he would rebel after learning of his liege's serpentine nature. His righteous stand was rewarded with imprisonment in an underground tomb.*\" - **Black Knight Andreas Ashes**\n\nInterestingly, while Andreas's English ashes say he remained a devout follower of *Messmer*, that's not what the Japanese says. In Japanese, Andreas's description says the following:\n\n\"\u9ec4\u91d1\u6a39\u3092\u8ffd\u308f\u308c\u3066\u306a\u304a\u3001\u656c\u8654\u306a\u4fe1\u5f92\u3067\u3042\u308a\u7d9a\u3051\" which essentially means, \"Even after being chased from the Erdtree, he remained a devout follower.\" It then goes on to describe him discovering Messmer's serpentine nature, as the English states. While there is *some* degree of ambiguity in the Japanese, the most natural way to read it is not that Andreas remained a devout follower of Messmer after *Messmer* was chased from the Erdtree. It's that Andreas remained a devout follower of the *Erdtree* even after *Andreas* was chased from the Erdtree. This also makes his rebellion against Messmer slightly more justified: He wasn't there for Messmer, he was there for the Erdtree, and rebelled against Messmer on discovering Messmer represented the serpent which is enemies with the Erdtree. (Imo this also makes Huw's story more tragic, as it paints it not as two of Messmer's close allies turning on him, but a soldier turning on him and that soldier's son who was comrades with Messmer being torn between family and friend.) With Andreas being on the Crusade for the Erdtree, despite *he himself* being chased from it, I believe this makes the most sense if the Crusade was seen as an act of penance by the Crusaders.\n\nGoing on that, in the Church District, we can find Queelign praying to Marika:\n\n\"*Favour me with thy grace. I have met many who would threaten or distress thee, and quelled each and all. And I hereby swear to never cease.* ***So, please, grant me thy grace.***\" - **Fire Knight Queelign**\n\nQueelign believes his duties as a crusader will earn him grace. Additionally, the Shadow Realm Runes provide a similar idea:\n\n\"*The soldiers who joined the crusade were rewarded with grace aplenty.*\" *-* **Shadow Realm Rune \\[3-4\\]**\n\n\"*The great heroes of the war were richly blessed by the grace of the Erdtree, but were not honored in death.*\" - **Rune of an Unsung Hero**\n\n\"*Golden remnants of the grace personally bestowed by Queen Marika to the heroes who joined the crusade for her.\" -* **Marika's Rune**\n\nThose who went on the crusade were, seemingly, blessed with grace at the beginning. Yet the Rune of an Unsung Hero tells us that the crusaders were not honored in death. Additionally, one of the places we can find a Marika's Rune is beneath the Fort of Reprimand. Notably, the courtyard of the Fort of Reprimand is full of hanging Messmer common soldiers. Firstly, the description of these men's gear gives further credence to the idea they were social pariahs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4qq8vs630xd1.png?width=1176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b2455da14d34a013f0733968523e9e4d7da3665\n\n\"*Cloth armor of the rank-and-file soldiers of Messmer's army.*\n\n*A pitch-dark soot clings to it, much like the inner faces of the men who wore them.\"* \\- **Common Soldier Cloth Armor**\n\nTheir having been hanged at the Fort of Reprimand (and the name of the fort itself) imply these were deserters from the military. And on the pile of corpses beneath this courtyard, we find one with one of Marika's Runes. It seems even those awarded the greatest gift of grace ended up having their doubts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsf2m6co20xd1.png?width=1281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6aef5ea3d0b74bb82cd9a85a4d10a940dd2ca90\n\nSo, having established that I believe the Crusade was a penitential war, what of Messmer? I will admit, this is the hardest for me to justify in my framework, but I believe it still works. Messmer was, likely, not looked well upon by the Erdtree nobility. As Gaius' remembrance states, Messmer was cursed. Additionally, he had bright red hair, which as we learned from the Giant's Red Braid, is looked down upon for it's ties to the giants. And of course his fire, which was anathema to the Erdtree. While Messmer's personality seems to have made his friends fiercely loyal to him, his very nature puts him at odds with the society he is a part of. This is strengthened by the amount of self-hate we see from him for his nature:\n\n\"*O lightless creature... Embrace thine oblivion, as shall I.*\" - **Messmer**\n\n\"*Messmer despised his own fire. Time and time again he hoped to rid himself of it, but ever did it burn.*\" - **Messmer's Orb**\n\nWith this in mind, it's likely that Messmer was made the face of the Crusade due to his conflicting with Leyndell's upper echelons. Whether some reason he was being sent was drummed up or he publicly volunteered I don't think matters, especially as we know Messmer knew his mother wanted the Crusade. What does matter, is: Why now? Why would Marika start a Crusade against the Hornsent so late in her reign, when she's been in control for a long time? And this brings us back to Rellana.\n\nRecall that I argued that Rellana's Helm places the Crusade as starting during Radagon and Rennala's marriage. Well, this next part is speculation, but I believe it gives the best answer for why the Crusade happened when it did. Something very important happened during Radagon and Rennala's marriage:\n\n\"***I was once an Empyrean.*** *Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.*\" - **Ranni**\n\nRanni, an Empyrean, was born to Radagon and Rennala. And why is this important?\n\n\"*An Empyrean...is no mere demigod. In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika, the precious Empyrean was born.* ***A new god to forge a new Order.***\" - **Gowry**\n\nWith Ranni's birth came a sign that Marika might be replaced. (As an aside, in Japanese, Rogier refers to Ranni as Radahn and Rykard's younger sister when he says \"*Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard*\", making it so the Crusade happening when Ranni was still very young possible). But what does sending her son and a bunch of pariahs on a Crusade against the Hornsent have to do with Ranni?\n\n\"*The tower of shadow houses a divine gateway. A well-kept secret, it was, but...* ***The gateway was once the birthplace of a god. A god we know all too well.***\" - **Ansbach**\n\nMarika used the Divine Gateway to become a god. As we see in the DLC, Miquella learned of this and set out to make use of the gateway himself. And Miquella has to go through many hoops to accomplish this. So that's why do the Crusade now. It kills several birds with one stone:\n\n1. Seal away your cursed son (who, btw, is capable of burning the Erdtree)\n2. Get rid of a bunch of criminals and outcasts.\n3. Get revenge on the people who massacred your people.\n4. Prevent anyone from usurping your godhood.\n\nBut if we accept these motivations, we now have to ask, when did the sealing of the Land of Shadow and Enir-Ilim happen?\n\n# Sealing: When? Betrayals: How many?\n\nTo start with, the sealing of Enir-Ilim is the easier of the two to answer. We are essentially told by Hornsent Grandam when it occurred:\n\n\"*Our lands were by thy kind set aflame,* ***our tower by thy kind veiled in shadow.***\" - **Hornsent Grandam**\n\nGrandam links the crusade (their lands being set aflame) with the tower being veiled. So it's safe for us to assume that the Crusade was when Enir-Ilim was sealed. (This also aligns with the belief that Marika did the Crusade at least partially to obscure the Divine Gate.)\n\nBut, what about the Land of Shadow? Sadly, it's sealing isn't nearly as clear. But, we have some decent indicators. Firstly, the story trailer provides evidence of the veil being over the Scadutree during Messmer's crusade.\n\n[Clickbait Arrows](https://preview.redd.it/uv0wfhui1zwd1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b01a8d6b934e62772451c686f23bb9a2b4f2e87)\n\nAdditionally, right before this pan up to reveal the veil, we see the aftermath of Messmer's battle:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoxjqqzq1zwd1.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10eaa912afe6720d49e6c166e1d291464a227bca\n\nMessmer is seen standing before the impaled corpses of three Divine Beasts, as well as many human figures. This fact might gives us some indicators of when this scene takes place:\n\n\"***Though a champion of the divine beast hunt****, he followed his father, Andreas, into rebellion against Messmer, and like his father, he too was imprisoned in an underground tomb. Messmer mourned the loss of a brother-in-arms.\" -* **Black Knight Huw Ashes**\n\n\"***The majority of divine beasts were gored and hung upon Messmer's spears, then burned in his flame.*** *Those who witnessed the deed likened it to a funeral pyre for the tower itself.\" -* **Divine Beast Tornado**\n\nIf what we are looking at is the Divine Beast hunt described in Huw's ashes, and Messmer spearing these divine beasts is \"likened to a funeral pyre for the tower\", I believe this would make the most sense for this to be the end of the Crusade, at least in terms of it's major campaigns. Belurat by all accounts appears to be the Hornsent capital, so a funeral pyre for it and its tower would likely represent the defeat of the Hornsent. As such, the story trailer seems to be saying that at is functionally the end of the Crusade, the land was already veiled. But I believe we have good reason to believe this veiling was specifically *during* the Crusade. Let us return to Grandam:\n\n\"***Take vengeance upon Messmer*** *and his lot. They* ***who betrayed us****, aye, they* ***who burned us****...\" -* **Hornsent Grandam**\n\nGrandam links the Crusade, the burning of their lands, with Marika's betrayal. Hornsent also does this:\n\n\"*By Marika long* ***betray'd, set aflame****.*\" - **Hornsent**\n\nSo, the Hornsent feel betrayed by Marika *for* the Crusade. But there's something important about the veiling of the Land of Shadow that would contradict this is the veiling happened earlier:\n\n\"*In an age long past,* ***before this land was enshrouded in shadow****, the vitality of the Crucible flourished. Remains of this can be seen in the ancient ruins.*\" - Aspects of the Crucible: Thorns\n\nThe Hornsent, quite evidently, revere the Crucible. And yet, as this incantation tells us, the land of shadow becoming the land of shadow weakened the Crucible's power. Perhaps it was not the veiling itself that weakened it, but perhaps Marika's ascension and her creating the Erdtree? After all, the Story Trailer also tells us about a betrayal. However, in either case, this doesn't work: If Hornsent and Grandam find the Crusade to be a betrayal, an earlier betrayal of the Hornsent by Marika couldn't have occurred. If they felt betrayed by Marika for the Crusade after she'd already betrayed them with her ascension and veiling the Land in Shadow, they're not very bright. Luckily, even the story trailer itself separates Marika's ascension and the Crusade. Leda says,\n\n\"*Miquella the Kind spoke of the* ***beginning****. Of the seduction, and the betrayal. An affair from which gold arose. And so too was shadow born.*\" - This describes Marika's ascension at the gate of divinity. One might believe this statement implies that gold arising and shadow being born refers to the Erdtree and Scadutree, thus this is when the veiling happened. Personally I don't think it refers to this, but even granting it does, I don't believe the Scadutree is *necessary* to the veiling. Regardless, let's get to the next point.\n\n\"***What followed was a war unseen.***\" - In other words, the Crusade.\n\nSo Leda describes the **beginning**, Marika's ascension, with the term betrayal. She then says that, following this, was **the Crusade**. As such, it seems impossible to treat the betrayal of the Hornsent as the betrayal described by Leda, unless the Hornsent are just very bad at picking who they give second chances to. I think it's very unlikely for the land to have been veiled before the Crusade, in order to make sense of the Hornsents' feelings of betrayal. As to what the betrayal at the beginning was, I don't think is relevant to this post, but suffice it to say I don't believe it was of the Hornsent.\n\nSo I've established why I believe that the Crusade happened near the end of Radagon and Rennala's marriage, after Ranni was born. Additionally, I've argued why I believe both Enir-Ilim and the Land of Shadow were sealed at the same time. So my timeline looks like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szqc4cu1uzwd1.png?width=10383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8161e59ea472717962e8548600440bb6d7023cec\n\nNow, we'll move on to the end of the events in the Land of Shadow, specifically in relation to Messmer, and why the Tarnished's existence on the timeline means we know Marika abandoned him and always intended to.\n\n# On His Mother's Wishes\n\nThe important thing to remember about Messmer in understanding the events of the DLC is that he loved Marika. And it's not hard to see why. Messmer's chamber alone has a statue depicting Marika holding a child, likely Messmer himself. Additionally, we learn from the Blessings of Marika the special treatment Messmer received.\n\n\"*Marika once created several of these physicks for Messmer's sake. But never again.*\" - **Blessing of Marika**\n\nMarika loved his mother so much that he went on the Crusade at her request.\n\n\"*On his mother's wishes, Messmer made himself a symbol of fear, undertaking the cleansing crusade she desired. 'Direct thy maledictions, thine ire, and thy grief towards me alone.'*\" - **Messmer's Armor**\n\nNot only did Messmer undertake the Crusade as his mother desired, he also wished for those suffering under it to blame him rather than her. He cared deeply for her, and trusted in her.\n\nBut at some point during the Crusade doubt began to set in. Likely first among the soldiers, with Messmer continuing to believe in his mother. We see signs of this doubt throughout the Land of Shadow. All of Marika's statues but that in Messmer's own chamber have been decapitated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kn0wdobyzzwd1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56f43244bcff3d0a62bdab86015b91a6665292ed\n\nAnd we see ghosts both in the Shadow Keep and Castle Ensis who are questioning why the Crusade hasn't ended yet.\n\n[Morgott and Mohg could not be reached for comment](https://preview.redd.it/q9e9u9nq40xd1.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dafc7c657b547c1cd9d19aa8623a0e01d51bea4a)\n\n\"*No, such a thing is utterly inconceivable... We have not been abandoned. Messmer is the son of Queen Marika... Her Grace would never abandon her own flesh and blood...*\" - **Shadow Keep Ghost**\n\n\"*O Marika... I beg...embrace your child... And give us a sign. How long must this holy war stretch on?\" -* **Castle Ensis Ghost**\n\nAnd eventually, even Messmer would begin to doubt. Now, we've already seen why I believe Messmer was sealed away when the Crusade began or near to it. But Messmer's own words on us entering his chamber give us good reason to believe Marika had always intended on leaving him in the Land of Shadow:\n\n\" *Mongrel intruder.* ***Thou'rt Tarnished, it seemeth. Mother, wouldst thou truly Lordship sanction, in one so bereft of light?*** \n\n*Yet...****my purpose standeth unchanged. Those stripped of the Grace of Gold shall all meet death.*** *In the embrace of Messmer's flame.*\" - **Messmer**\n\nWe are given two important pieces of information from this dialogue: \n\n1. Messmer's purpose in the Land of Shadow, and in performing the Crusade, was to kill those without Grace. And,\n2. Messmer didn't know the Tarnished had Lordship sanctioned by Marika until recently.\n\nWhy do we know 2? If we wanted to use cut content, we could go off of the fact that in this dialogue, Messmer specifically referenced learning about the Tarnished from Miquella. But even ignoring cut content, it's because of how Messmer uses point 1 to justify attacking us: Messmer is surprised his mother would sanction the lordship for a group of people without grace. But he uses the loophole of his purpose being to kill those without grace as an excuse to fight us.\n\nWith that thought in our heads, this helps us further both our understanding of the Land of Shadow's sealing on the timeline, and our understanding of Marika's abandoning Messmer. Let's look at Marika's echoes:\n\n\"***My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.*** *With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between. Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.* \n\n*Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.* ***Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.*** *Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.\" -* **Echoes of Marika, 3rd Church of Marika and Church of Pilgrimage**\n\nMarika, as soon as she banished Godfrey, had already promised him and his warriors they would return to brandish the Elden Ring. In other words, *the Tarnished's lordship was sanctioned from the word go*. So, Messmer's reaction to us leaves a few options as to what occurred. \n\n1. Messmer was sealed away *before* the Tarnished were banished, and only finds out about them and their being sanctioned for lordship shortly before our arrival (this is what I have argued for).\n2. Messmer was sealed later in the timeline, and was thus aware of the Tarnished, but not aware of their lordship having been sanctioned. This could make sense, as the Tarnished's lordship being sanctioned *by* Marika seems a relatively well guarded secret. Or,\n3. Messmer was sealed later in the timeline, and knew the Tarnished were sanctioned for lordship, but is just mad.\n\nOption 3 seems obviously false to me. Messmer's reaction both sounds like he was unaware of his mother's actions until recently (\"*wouldst thou truly\"*), and also he would have to be *very* petty to just suddenly decide to screw his mom's plan up if he'd known it this whole time. Option 2 also seems to be false, though not as clearly as 3. First, there's all the reasons we've gone over for why Messmer would have been sealed prior in the timeline. Additionally, if we accepted 2 as true, I don't really understand what Marika's end game with Messmer would be.  She sends him on this mission, to kill those without the Grace of Gold, while also planning on having those without the Grace of Gold come back to become Lord someday, and not tell him? This would make sense if betraying Messmer was in some way part of her goal, but at that point it becomes easiest to just accept 1: Marika planned on abandoning Messmer, and he only learns about her goals recently on the timeline. And this also makes the most sense with his dying words:\n\n\"*Mother... Marika... A curse...upon thee...\" -* **Messmer**\n\nMessmer curses Marika because reality has finally caught up with him: He was sent on a war to kill those stripped of the grace of gold, happily taking on the role to make his mother happy. Then, he was left trapped in the Realm of Shadow, unable to contact her, but holding out hope that she'd come back for him. But the next thing he knows, a Tarnished has shown up. Whether he learned it from Miquella or elsewhere, he learns his mother has allowed this graceless person to take the throne of Elden Lord after instilling in him the need to eradicate those without grace. All the worse of a betrayal when he's had such hatred for his own dark nature. And so he confronts the Tarnished, being pushed to the point of abandoning the seal his mother made him in a desperate attempt to survive. And at the end, he accepts that his mother has lied to him, left him locked away, and now guided a new lord to him with her grace in that lord's efforts to kill his brother to prevent his ascension to godhood. Messmer curses Marika because she used him and threw him away.\n\nWith my screed as Marika's number 1 hater out of the way, I now would like to address some loose ends on the timeline regarding the crusade:\n\n# Odds and Ends\n\nThe first one is the presence of the Death Knights. Given their ties to Godwyn, it seems like their arrival must post-date the Night of Black Knives. But this doesn't actually present much of a problem for us if we look at their gear:\n\n\"*Golden helm of the Death Knights,* ***whose own death masks served as the visards of their armor.***\" - **Death Knight Helm**\n\nA death mask is \"a likeness (typically in wax or plaster cast) of a person's face after their death\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_mask)). So these knights are already dead. So how are they here? Simple:\n\n*\"The very center of the Lands Between. All manners of Death wash up here, only to be suppressed.*\" - **Suppressing Pillar**\n\nJust as the Mausoleum Knights beheaded themselves to follow their masters into death, it makes the most sense in my view that the Death Knights simply performed a ritual in which their deaths would bring them to the Land of Shadow.\n\nAnother strange presence in the LoS is the Tree Sentinel with a Sentry's Torch. The Torch description tells us:  \n  \n\"*Torch given to protectors of the Erdtree. Its flames are bestowed with a special incantation which allows the bearer to see assassins cloaked in veils.* ***Furnished on behalf of the Erdtree and the Grace-Given Lord such that a Night of Black Knives will never come again.****\" -* **Sentry's Torch**\n\nHere, we can see that this would imply that this Sentinel shouldn't be here unless it arrived after the Night of Black Knives. However, there is one problem with this assumption, and also a solution to this anyway. The problem is, if you're like me, you believe all signs point to Morgott not escaping his imprisonment until right after the shattering the Ring. If so, that would put this Sentinel as even *later* in the timeline, being during the Shattering. However, the solution is simple: Morgott simply furnished the flames of the Sentry's torches we see in the base game with the *incantation*, rather than the torches themselves. So the torches as items pre-existed, but their magical ability to reveal invisible things was something Morgott produced.\n\nAnd the last one is Red Bear. The problem comes from his helmet:\n\n\"*Helm of Red Bear, whose name is lost to madness. The cheek guards are shaped after lion fangs.*  \n*Perhaps his fascination with the untamed strength of the wild stemmed from* ***his past as a Redmane.***\" - **Fang Helm**\n\nIf Red Bear is a Redmane, then it would imply that Radahn had a military serving beneath him some time before the Land of Shadow was sealed. It's *possible* Radahn already had such a following before Radagon left Rennala, so it *could* still work, but honestly I just hate Red Bear. The trailer showing the Land of Shadow being veiled during the crusade makes it hard to argue he would have arrived as late as we might expect the Redmanes exist. Honestly, I really do just despise Red Bear's existence, and like to just go with the cop out of \"he died and ended up here, I guess.\"\n\nSo that's it. A lot of this isn't as organized as I'd have liked, particularly toward the end, but I don't really want to spend much more on this as it's mostly just to get my thoughts out. Here's the timeline picture again, and a tl;dr of the main points.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6np2q861c1xd1.png?width=10383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a3ef48ee30485ac62c2a1156d1bdd0ae4757124\n\nTl;dr: The Crusade occurs during the end of Radagon's marriage to Rennala, with Ranni's birth triggering Marika to hide the gate of divinity. The Crusade was a penitential war that served to seal away Messmer, wipe out the hornsent, and rid society of undesirables. Due to the Hornsent's beliefs about Marika and the story trailer, it seems the Land of Shadow was veiled during the Crusade, along with Enir-Ilim. And Messmer was left behind by Marika, as evidenced by his not being privy to her plan for the Tarnished.",

Messmer has his red hair, he was born cursed like Malenia, and a motif of Radagons theme plays during his boss fight. It's so obvious.\" \n\nYet the more we learn about Messmer, the more we know he was around long before Godfrey was banished. Gaius' remembrance tells us that Messmer was like an older brother to RADhan. Putting him older than carians. There's even some speculation he fought in the war with the Giants(aside from how the fire Giants are impaled on the mountaintops, the Ash of War Giant hunt is exactly the same as Flame skewer)\n\nBecause of this some have said that Messmer was the secret first born of Marika, but this is outright contradicted by Godrick's great rune.\"The golden lineage was the first of the demigods\" \n\n\nSo how could Messmer be Radagons son if he was born before Radagon and Rennala got together but after the Golden lineage was established? Well I think I have the answer. Godwyn and Messmer are twins. They are the \"Birth of gold and shadow\" \n\nGodwyn the GOLDEN, prince of GOLD was born with the light while Messmer was born with the Abyssal serpent, SHORN OF LIGHT. They're opposites. And unlike Rennala, Marika seems to always have twins when she gives birth. Mohg/Morgott and Miquella\\Malenia being the most obvious examples. \n\nNotice how the Abyssal serpent in Messmers eye looks like a snake mating ball. For those who don't know, a snake mating ball is when 2 or more male snakes try to impregnate one female snake. They end up forming a tangled ball of snakes that looks suspiciously like the base/Abyssal serpent.\n\nTl:Dr,  I believe Messmer and Godwyn are twins with different fathers",

    "body": "I have a few ideas that I want to get out of my head. Mainly that Marika is either omniscient, or has greater foresight of what's to come. I think that upon becoming a God, she learned her own fate, the fate of her Golden Order and the fates of her children. I think a lot of Marika's actions at the start of her reign were her attempts at overcoming the vision of the world that she saw, and that as time went on, she began to accept and even welcome it.\n\nFirstly, I want to look at Miquella's abduction. Marika was locked away in the Erdtree after the shattering, however, when we tell Gideon about Mohg and the cocoon, he tells us, \"...I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree, but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form... Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified...\" This begs the question, how could Marika have even known, in order to be sorrowful? Her Children were already given shards of the Elden Ring. According to Freya in the DLC, \"I was left behind, and only Kindly Miquella was enough to seek me out. My wound was swollen and festering \u2014 exuding a most pungent odour \u2014 and yet he drained the poison from it.\" This means the Shattering War was well under way before Miquella was taken. Either Marika knew Miquella's fate beforehand, or she wasn't imprisoned within the Erdtree until later than we thought.\n\nSecondly, let's briefly look at the war with the Fire Giants and the sealing of Destined Death. Marika knew the risks of leaving this forces be - the flames of the giants could burn the Erdtree, and the black flame/unsealed Destined Death could kill the demigods. Marika knew that these were threats to her order, but if she had foresight into Miquella, it's possible she went to war with the Fire Giants and sealed Destined Death because she had visions of Godwyn and the other demigods dying. She saw the Erdtree burning in the future, but she didn't know she would be the one to call the Tarnished back to do it.\n\nMarika also could have inspired Miquella to charm Mohg and make him the vessel. Marika warns Miquella, and Miquella makes his own plans, including charming Mohg to ensure it happens. Perhaps this is why Godwyn was targeted as the martyr for Destined Death, Marika saw his death, warned others of her visions, and Ranni ensured it happened. Later, Marika realizes that she can't stop destiny, despite her being a God, and calls back the Tarnished to burn the Erdtree and become Lord.\n\nAnother possibility I'm mulling over is maybe the Nox as a culture just had a really clear vision of fate. Marika has ties to the Nox, so maybe it wasn't unique to her. ",

    "body": "So I am currently cooking up a Marika\u2019s Motivations lore piece and in the process of piecing together her puzzle I came across this one piece of dialogue which seems to have been missed by the entire community regarding Miquella\u2019s kidnapping (me included).\n\nFirst thing first, [the timeline places the most important events of the world like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/rg71b4/a_look_at_the_jp_subtitles_to_the_third_trailer/): Night of the Black Knives where Godwyn is killed &gt; Marika shatters the Elden Ring and is imprisoned in the Erdtree &gt; the Demigods war for the shards of the Ring in what is called the Shattering War.\n\nWith that out of the way, after you defeat Malenia in the Haligtree and go back to talk to Gideon Ofnir in the Roundtable Hold, he tells you:\n\n&gt;*So. The Haligtree, now but a husk... I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree, but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form. Indeed, it seems those words held weight. How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story...* ***Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified...*** *Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.*\n\nI have never seen this piece of dialogue mentioned when theorizing on the timeline of Miquella being taken by Mohg, like, ever. This line seems to implicate that Queen Marika, before she was imprisoned in the Erdtree, grieved over Miquella\u2019s disappearance. Meaning that Mohg rising from the Leyndell sewers and abducting Miquella happened before Marika shattered the Elden Ring and the subsequent Shattering War.\n\nFor me, this throws a wrench in my understanding of the already vague as hell timeline. I wasn\u2019t under the impression that Morgott and Mohg rose from the sewers before the power vacuum in Leyndell happened because of Godwyn dying and Marika disappearing. The chaos that ensued after Marika went MIA seems like the most logical moment for those two to leave the sewers.\n\nFurthermore, even though it is never explicitly stated, the most logical moment for Mohg to take Miquella from what is technically the most inaccessible region in the whole world, seems to be when Malenia had left the Haligtree to start her march towards Caelid. It\u2019s also the most agreed upon moment for Mohg to have done this in the community.\n\nHowever, if Mohg indeed took Miquella before Malenia left the Haligtree, then that answers the mystery as to why Malenia marched towards Caelid in the first place. Originally, I believed it was because Radahn was the biggest threat to the Miquella camp. Out of all the Demigods taking part in the Shattering War, Ranni was MIA, Rykard was driven back to Mt. Gelmir by Leyndell forces, Godrick was sitting idle in Limgrave with his tail between his legs, and Morgott, Veiled Monarch of Leyndell, was the last boss anyway. Radahn was the one with a standing army and seemed to be the most likely contender for Elden Lord, or in other words, the biggest obstacle to overcome for Miquella to realize his plans.\n\nWith that being said, if we take that one line from Gideon as proof that Miquella was kidnapped before the Shattering happened, that changes things. Mostly, it explains Malenia\u2019s campaign against Caelid. Mohgwyn Palace is, after all, right underneath Sellia Gateway. And right next to Sellia Gateway is the Aeonia Swamp battlefield where Malenia bloomed and passed out\u2026\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86zucduvtm691.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0522d2a668c8dd9a670896d1cb42ceadbb03ec7\n\n[I didn't move the cursor in any way in these screenshots.](https://preview.redd.it/lkbohilxtm691.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4505a8389dc23d517cfea7c3e257d302e711514)\n\nWhat leaves me confused is that I was actually under the impression that the battle between Malenia and Radahn was one of if not the last big events that went down before the Tarnished, us the players, woke up. So I believed that Mohg taking Miquella was also one of the last big events that went down, closer to the end of the timeline of the Shattering War, instead of an event that predated it.\n\nMiquella being kidnapped before Marika shattered the Ring would mean that Malenia and him left Leyndell and the doctrine of the Golden Order while it was still functioning, no? Since the Golden Order sort of fell apart once Marika disappeared. I thought that the perfect time for Miquella to grow his Haligtree was when the Golden Order lost its way in the chaos of the Shattering War. Miquella, an Empyrean, Marika and Radagon\u2019s only son, an heir candidate, turning his back on the Golden Order and technically betraying the Greater Will in the worst way possible (creating his own tree which is supposed to rival the great Erdtree; is this not heresy in the worst way?), and Marika/the GW allowed this to happen? ~~I mean this fits perfectly into my theory that Marika, contrary to popular belief, loved her children and fought for them but that\u2019s a topic for another time and I won\u2019t be posting that theory for another 2 or 3 months lol.~~\n\nOkay anyways, here\u2019s what I **originally** believed the timeline to roughly go like:\n\n1. Night of the Black Knives where Godwyn is assassinated and Ranni goes MIA.\n2. Some time passes, Marika grieves, Godwyn\u2019s unresponsive body is buried in Deeproot Depths.\n3. Marika shatters the Elden Ring out of grief; chaos ensues because this is an unforeseen event and there is no heir left since Marika and Radagon are imprisoned in the Erdtree, Godwyn is dead, and all three Empyrean children have disavowed the Golden Order.\n4. All Demigod children take the shards of the Elden Ring and go their own way: Malenia and Miquella leave to grow their Haligree; Ranni is MIA; Rykard settles in Volcano Manor and meets/fuses with the God-Devouring Serpent (this event probably has already happened at this point of time, but his ambitions are only coming to fruition now since the Golden Order is in chaos); Radahn is chilling in Caelid with the Redmanes.\n5. Leyndell is left with no ruler and this makes the perfect moment for the two Omen children to rise from the sewers to which they had been exiled. Morgott takes the throne and is named the Veiled Monarch, Mohg has no interest and leaves to Mohgwyn Palace in order to set the stage for the kidnapping of an Empyrean.\n6. First Defense of Leyndell. **Altus Highway Junction** Sword Hill Monument states *\u201cThe First Defense of Leyndell. A sovereign alliance rots from within. Traces yet remain of bloody conspiracy.\u201d* This makes me think it was Rykard\u2019s Volcano Manor forces that laid siege to Leyndell and Morgott and his forces fended them off.\n7. Godrick and Godefroy escape Leyndell in the chaos. Godefroy is captured by Dragon Knight Kristoff, whereas Godrick manages to flee to Limgrave.\n8. Leyndell forces push Rykard\u2019s forces back to Mt. Gelmir. **Ninth Mount Gelmir Campsite** Sword Hill Monument states *\u201cThe Assault on Volcano Manor. The squalid, the sick, the blasphemous; a wretched, unending war with no glory.\u201d*\n9. The Second Defense of Leyndell. The **Outer Wall Battleground** Sword Hill Monument states *\u201cThe Second Defense of Leyndell. The Fell Omen stacks high the corpses of heroes. Yet the Erdtree remains unshaken.\u201d* From the intro cinematic we know that Radahn also laid siege to Leyndell. The Second Defense was most likely him and the Redmanes vs. Morgott\u2019s forces. Radahn and his army are defeated and fall back to Caelid. I won\u2019t deny that it could\u2019ve also been Radahn\u2019s forces that came first and the Second Defense of Leyndell was against Rykard, but there is nothing that clearly says which assault came first so Idk.\n10. Malenia starts her southward march to Caelid. She meets and defeats (more like bitch-slaps) Godrick on the way, but does not take his Great Rune, because the Miquella Camp is not interested in restoring the Elden Ring.\n11. With the biggest obstacle absent from the Haligtree, Mohg sets his plan into motion: he takes Miquella from the Haligtree which he had been steadily growing since the start of the Shattering War. (Why Miquella specifically? Well there are only 3 Empyreans and one of them has been MIA since forever, and the other would totally shish-kebob him within a second. Miquella is physically the weakest and the most vulnerable, so he is easy prey, is what I believe.) Mohg succeeds and takes Miquella to the hidden place of Mohgwyn Palace.\n12. Malenia and Radahn clash in the Swamp of Aeonia. It is a tie until Malenia unleashes her Scarlet Rot. Radahn and Caelid are permanently taken out of the game and Malenia passes out. She is carried back to the Haligtree, all the while she is in a coma. She does not know Miquella is gone.\n13. The constant battles fizzle out. The Shattering War comes to a standstill. There is no victor. Radahn is incapacitated. Ranni is still MIA. Rykard is regrouping in Volcano Manor. Godrick is hiding out in Stormveil Castle. Mohg has Miquella and is hidden away underground. Malenia is in a coma. Morgott rules Leyndell but has no greed for power so the only thing he does is defend the throne from outside forces.\n14. The exiled Tarnished start to come back to life and return to the Lands Between. Morgott seals off Leyndell in order to keep them all out.\n15. Us, the Tarnished player, come back to life. Elden Ring\u2019s story starts. Malenia only wakes up from her slumber once we enter her resting place; Ranni\u2019s location is discovered only by us; All Demigods sans Ranni, Malenia and Miquella die if you do a full genocide run (yes I believe Malenia only bloomed twice and isn\u2019t dead yet don\u2019t argue with me on this Idc).\n\nThis is what I originally believed the timeline to be like. But with the implications that Miquella was kidnapped **before** the Shattering War happened, the timeline has been turned upside down. The second interpretation goes like this:\n\n1. Miquella disavows the Golden Order and leaves Leyndell, taking Malenia with him to the Consecrated Snowfields to create the Haligtree.\n2. Mohg rises from the sewers and takes Miquella to Mohgwyn Palace. Marika (and let's be real ... Malenia too) grieves over this incident.\n3. The Night of the Black Knives where Godwyn is assassinated happens and Ranni goes MIA. It is very much so possible point 2 &amp; 3 are switched, but I have no way of knowing which came first.\n4. The loss of both Miquella and Godwyn (and Malenia too, technically) leaves Marika in a sea of despair. Godwyn is buried in Deeproot Depths and Marika shatters the Elden Ring.\n5. The Demigod children take the shards of the Elden Ring and go their own way.\n6. Leyndell is left with a power vacuum. Morgott rises from the sewers and takes control of the throne.\n7. First Defense of Leyndell happens. Whether it was Radahn that laid siege to Leyndell first or whether it was Rykard that did it, I don\u2019t know.\n8. In the chaos of the First Defense, Godrick and Godefroy flee from the capital city. Godefroy is captured, Godrick escapes to Limgrave.\n9. The Assault on Volcano Manor. Leyndell forces push Rykard and his army back to Mt. Gelmir.\n10. Second Defense of Leyndell. If the second siege was done by Radahn, then the Assault on Volcano Manor happened after the First Defense of Leyndell. If it was Rykard that started the second conflict, then the Assault on Volcano Manor happened after the Second Defense of Leyndell.\n11. Malenia, finally having found out where Miquella is, mobilizes her army to march towards Sellia in Caelid. Right underneath Sellia Gateway is Mohgwyn Palace, Malenia\u2019s objective.\n12. Radahn meets her in battle, not knowing why she\u2019s there. Radahn is eventually permanently incapacitated and Malenia fails in achieving her objective. She falls into a coma and is carried back to the Haligtree where she stays asleep, forever waiting on Miquella.\n13. The constant battles fizzle out. It is the end of the Shattering War. No victor arises.\n14. The exiled Tarnished start to come back to life. Morgott keeps Leyndell closed off.\n15. Elden Ring\u2019s story starts.\n\nSomewhere at the start of the Shattering War, either during or right after the First Defense of Leyndell, or maybe even right after Marika is imprisoned, Raya Lucaria and the Liurnians declare they shall take no part in the war. There is a conflict between the Cuckoo knights/the Raya Lucaria sorcerers/the Carian Royal family. I am however too lazy to look up which items describe this and in the grand scheme of things, the Liurnians and Carians don\u2019t matter so it's whatever. All I know for sure is that they declared they won\u2019t be warring at the start of the Shattering.\n\nOkay so what do you guys think? Is this timeline viable? Should we take Gideon\u2019s line as seriously as I\u2019m taking it right now? What are you guys\u2019 interpretations of the timeline of the Shattering War?\n\n~~Also, don't argue with me on Marika grieving over the loss of her children. I have my interpretation of her and I won't be swayed. I'll publish a lore post on her in like 2 months talking about it so this is not the place to discuss that detail.~~\n\nP.S. English is not my first language (more like fourth) so please excuse any grammar mistakes. I am aware I make them but I don\u2019t know how to correct myself so I just write down whatever.",

    "body": "Hello everybody. This post is less about stating what I currently believe and more putting forth something to get some feedback from the broader community. In Nightreign there is one of the \"secret\" achievements I just got recently called \"Old Gaol\", it's description being to \"complete the oldest gaol.\" You can achieve it by defeating one of 3 specific enemy spawns from an Evergaol; an Ancient Dragon, a Deathrite Bird, or the Godskin Duo.\n\nThe first two are obvious. We know the Ancient Dragons are one of if not the oldest beings in the Lands Between. Similarly, the Deathrite Birds seem to be a relic of a bygone era, with most things about the Twinbirds not having any real history remaining and their bodies themselves looking broken and worn down over years. The Godskin Duo, however, are interesting. A lot of people place the Godskin and relatedly the Gloam Eyed Queen to be contemporary with Marika, somebody who competed with her for power or tried to rise up against her or something else similar. However, this achievement to me seems to be saying that the Godskin are as old as at least the Deathrite Birds even if they are not quite as old as the Ancient Dragons. Either way, this feels to me as if it places the Godskin far earlier in the timeline than a lot of people assume.\n\nJust wanted to get people's thoughts and feelings on this. Do you think the wording and name of the achievement don't really mean anything in terms of how old the Godskin are or does this change where you think they appear in the timeline? Let me know, I'm still thinking on it a lot myself.",

Though I agree with some of their observations, I have a different interpretation of the image as a whole - one which (I think) deserves a rather lengthy post. \n\nAbout half of this post are general observations, which I believe to be relatively certain facts - those are written normally. *The other half are my personal speculations and theories, which are written in cursive*. So let's get into analyzing fictional historical art :)\n\n**A timeline of eras** \n\nFundamentally, the image is a timeline of major epochs throughout the history of the Lands Between, symbolized and connected by the theme of different great trees. Each unique tree is one era, depicting the specific great tree which grew at that time. The timeline, just like the great trees, are connected by one central stem. This symbolizes the flow of time and order of events, but also the metaphorical and literal relationship the different trees had to each other: each tree (and era) literally grew out of and replaced its predecessor. The events start at the top in prehistory, and descend into the immediate present. \n\n**The Founding Conifer**\n\n[The first, primordial conifer, planted by giants. ](https://preview.redd.it/cvvfz7vv52uc1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=545b0e7b97c480fc42dcbb04ad92203fd3867555)\n\nThe very top of the relief shows a spiky tree, which is obviously not leafed. It's a conifer, the same (spirit)tree found all over the Mountaintops, and on several other artifacts. It was the first tree planted by the giants, or their larger predecessors - some like to call them the Titans or Builders, a race which are believed to have built large portions of the continent. As one of the first races, if not THE first race to inhabit the fledgling Lands Between, they are the ones who started its culture and civilization - and also the ones who planted the first great tree (let's call it the Founding Conifer). \n\n*I don't think that the concept of a civilization living around a great tree is unique in the world of ER. I wouldn't be surprised if this concept predated the LB, and that the giants/Builders imported this culture from their original civilization. Think of a mythical land of giants, living around a truly enormous Worldtree, from which a group/tribe split off and traveled to distant lands. There, in the middle of the shallow and warm ocean, they built the first structure of the Lands Between: a bed for a sapling from the Worldtree, a continuation of their homeland.* \n\n*This act, taking the seed/sapling of a great tree and beginning a new civilization in the middle of the ocean, may be what inspired Miquella to build Elphael and plant the Haligtree: a symbolic new beginning for a continuing culture. The Lands Between, which are interwoven by an underground network of massive pillars and structures, may have started out like Elphael: the original brace of the original tree. The structure was later expanded and buried by meteoric showers, the roots of the great trees, volcanic activity and other processes, which formed the current Lands between.* \n\n*As to why the giants (and other races) chose this place specifically to settle down, I can only think of one reason mentioned in the lore: this is where the Elden Beast, a great golden star - and also a sort of aquatic creature, crashed into the ocean. Since the current Firegiants venerated meteorites and are heavily associated with astrology, it's reasonable to assume that their progenitors followed a great, golden meteorite, and founded the Lands Between around it (and its influence).*  \n\n**The era of the Crucible**\n\n[The Crucible - a massive sprouting of life.](https://preview.redd.it/fsj5oujd03uc1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b740b1b08e7bf100f6dd374d18abdf591ed41ce)\n\nThe second epoch is the era of the Crucible: a massive, chaotic sprouting of life in the Lands Between. The primordial soup of life - the Crucible - emanated life energy, which lead to rapid evolution and devolution, the mixing and creation of races. This is the era of beasts and dragons, at the height of which stood Farum Azula, along with other cultures such as the Ancient Dynasties or the Nox. \n\nThe first, small and simple conifer grows into a massive tree - also a conifer. Note the difference between the relatively orderly, straight branches of the smaller Founding Conifer, and the twisted, chaotic and sprouting branches of this much larger lower half. Its chaotic form is similar to the imagery of sprouting/budding branches of Crucible Knights. Both halves are (of) the same tree throughout the ages, but one is much larger and widespread, just like the amount of life, races and cultures encompassing the Crucible Era. \n\n*In his original post,* [*emmettflo*](https://www.reddit.com/user/emmettflo/) *noticed the similarity between the highlighted branches and the symbol of Rot. I also agree that there is a lot of similarity, the symbol matches the branches perfectly when laid over each other... It could, of course, be a coincidence created by the mirrored nature of the entire relief. Regardless, the symbol could be meaningful enough to Marika or Radagon (or whoever commissioned the relief) as Scarlet Rot is heavily associated with the Ancient Dynasties - specifically with their downfall and the Lake of Rot. Since the Dynasties were (arguably) a human civilization, which surely inspired Erdtree culture in some way, their succumbing to the Rot may be represented as a symbolic, human-centered end to the era of the Crucible.*\n\n *Also note the bulbous, random stuff marked by white circles. I will expand on it in the next section, and how it could relate to the sudden blossoming of life and the Crucible.*  \n\nOverall, the Founding Conifer and the Crucible represent the whole of prehistory and ancient times, combined into one connected tree. I would put anything else which would predate Marika, the Golden Order or cultures of the Erdtree, into this upper third of the relief. \n\n**Marika's beginnings: replanting the Great Tree**\n\n[A young oak - the Erdtree replaces the conifer.](https://preview.redd.it/8h29d9n9f3uc1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ae74667d7755318f8e3ac90527b80235312b930)\n\nIn the next part of the relief, an obviously different tree replaces the great conifer above it. Though it 'shares' the same stem, and thereby - at least symbolically - continues the function of the previous tree, it's most likely a young oak - the future Erdtree. \n\nThis symbolizes the beginning of Marika's rule, her comming to power and conquering the Lands Between. She replaces the previous conifer - the previous eras - and starts her own era, with a new tree and a new Godess. \n\n*The Tarnished Archeologist has several great videos about early Erdtree culture, as well as how a deciduous oak may have replaced the previous conifer through grafting onto its stem. This would be a symbolic, as well as an actual continuation of the previous conifer and its roots through the young Erdtree. Others play with the theory of several (ritualistic?) burnings of the great tree, to enrich the soil (entire Lands Between) and make place for new trees.*  \n\n*Note again the weird chaotic, bulbous things marked by white. They might also be appearing on other parts of the relief, but only sparsely and much less defined, so I couldn't make them out clearly. Personally, I could only find a larger concentration of them in this section - around the young Erdtreee, and between the eras of the Conifer and the Crucible. This is very speculative, but they might represent one of two things:* \n\n* *Sprouting seeds - A symbol of struggling groups, wars between factions which want to 'establish their own tree', in other words: rule the next era.* \n* *A great gatherings of beings - A symbol of some key event, which led to the beginning of a new era. Some theorize that the growing of a new great tree may not be as simple as planting the seed and waiting. Largely due to Miquella watering his Haligtree with blood and nourishing it with his body/Rune, a great tree may require a great amount of nutrients to grow - in other words, a ritual of mass sacrifice. Such a ritual may have provided enough nutrients to nourish the Crucible (perhaps through the dead bodies of the Builders) and to grow the Erdtree (through all the cultures defeated by Marika).* \n\n**Godfrey's era of the Erdtree**\n\n[The full-grown Erdtree and its wast roots.  ](https://preview.redd.it/ewkj8ew2m3uc1.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8b826715edd16312499e6c12a425ae24c7359cb)\n\nThis part is pretty self-explanatory: The Erdtree and its culture at the height of their power, under Godfrey's and Marika's rule. It stands unopposed, with its wast system of roots spreading wide - a symbol of both its actual roots, and of Marika's rule over the entire continent. \n\nNote the white 'central pillar' which ends here, it will become important shortly. \n\n**Radagon's era, Fundamentalism and the tree of light**\n\n[A new era of ideological perfection, devoid of the randomness of nature.  ](https://preview.redd.it/cs44fuxzm3uc1.png?width=1015&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac7328c03ac327c520155bd1c834f9d0387ca717)\n\nA drastic change to the natural continuation of the previous great trees: The era of Golden Order Fundamentalism and the golden tree of light. Under Radagon and Marika, the old oak is discarded - cut down or burned - and in its place stands the ethereal tree we all know, its crown symbolized by the triangular Elden Ring of this era. \n\nIt is no longer a natural, biological succession of the previous eras, but an ideological one. It also clearly separates itself from the previous (and following?) epochs through the two 'arrows' above and below it, and is not a part of the 'central pillar'. As to what these might be...\n\n**The pillar, arrows and the dagger**\n\n[The removal of death and the Night of Black Knives.](https://preview.redd.it/0tyh96y1r3uc1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e3966be924ba10c4aade4f12ae99fd37ac37e6)\n\nThe pillar, which acts as a stem for all depicted trees, connects them in a symbolic way and represents the continual function of the trees throughout the ages. *It may also symbolize that the trees literally grew out of each other, as hinted at before.* As to why it isn't connected to the triangular Elden Ring, this may again represent the 'higher', ethereal and perfect quality of the golden Erdtree, as opposed to the grounded, natural state of its predecessors. \n\n*The two arrows first reminded me of Marika's arch, but facing downwards. The Rune of Death has a similar downwards-facing arch, and is the dual opposite to Marika's power over life and births. The two arrows then, in my opinion, symbolize the two most important events in the history of the Golden Order:*\n\n* *Marika's removal of death from the Lands Between - The Rune of Death was removed from the Elden Ring, drastically changing life in the Lands Between. We don't actually know exactly when Marika did this, it may have been sooner (at the beginning of her rule). But I believe it plausible that the sealing of 'imperfect' death was her attempt of 'perfecting' the Golden Order, along with other actions, which kickstarted Golden Order Fundamentalism.* \n* *The Night of Black Knives - Where the Rune of Death was partially returned to the Lands Between (the lower arrow is much less clear, a bit narrower and misshapen), was used to slay Godwyn and (arguably) other Demigods, and ended the era of Golden Order Fundamentalism, followed by the Shattering.* \n\n*The sword or dagger-like shape (pirecring the ER and the lower arrow) pointing downwards could either specifically be the Night of Black knives and the 'dagger' which it plunged into the Golden Order, or generally the conflict, wars and infighting that would follow before and during the Shattering. It may also represent the Shattering itself, as a 'time of the sword' or 'time of political infighting'.* \n\n**Radagon's sealing of the Erdtree**\n\n[Radagon's trellis on the relief, his thorns underneath.](https://preview.redd.it/weyt4ua9f4uc1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8d910ca120c835399eb4fb4b431238f90911038)\n\nThe last prominent symbol on the relief, closest to the ground, are faint hints of Radagon's trellis. These symbolize him taking control of the Erdtree and sealing it after Marika shattered the Elden Ring and was crucified. \n\nHis magic, in the shape of his trellis, both symbolically (on the relief) and literally (behind the impenetrable thorns) covers the entrance to Marika. If that wasn't obvious enough, his actual thorns also appear directly behind and under the relief - sprouting from his trellis and attempting to cover the entrance. \n\n*I'm wondering how the original, undamaged seal would have looked like - if it had a gate behind the Elden Throne, or was a continuous wall build over thorns. In either case, Radagon's trellis would probably be covering the entire thing, or would perhaps depict Marika crucified.* \n\n*Another question is when and by whom the seal and its carvings were built/commissioned. Due to the order of events depicted, and since the seal seems to be relatively poorly made when compared to the beautiful pillars and architecture behind it, I'm thinking that it was ordered by Radagon as a symbolic seal of the Erdtree, shortly before casting his thorn magic and sealing himself inside of it.* \n\n**The Shattering**\n\n[The Shattering opens a path to lordship. ](https://preview.redd.it/rg1kj4r2k4uc1.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e93decd01fc46aaffed14c987c7d3fe4b84a056)\n\nWhat might be missing at first sight is the most recent era of events in the Lands Between: the Shattering. I would argue though that it is present in the environmental details, namely the massive crack tearing the entire relief apart. It very clearly symbolizes the destruction of the entire system, any semblance of culture and order in the Lands Between. *One observation worth mentioning is the fact, that the crack starts all the way at the upper arrow - the removal of death - as though this act, an affront to the natural order of life, was the beginning of the end for Marika's rule and the system as a whole.* \n\nIt is also a symbol of the wars and current power vacuum literally opening a path to lordship (the imminent, empty Elden Throne) and the promised ascension to godlike power (steps leading to a golden gate). This way, the entire relief starts in distant, unreachable prehistory, but descends throughout the ages and poetically ends in the immediate present: an empty throne ready for its Elden Lord. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "body": "As an avid lore enjoyer and history nut, I feel compelled to put my version of events into writing, some speculation, some stolen theories all mixed into a Crucible you might call it. Ok let\u2019s go.\n\n\n-Era of the Titans\n\u2022 The one great split into pieces. The chunks are still quite big compared to modernity. The largest is called what it literally is, the greater will.\n\u2022The smaller chunks that are too small to become outer gods form the first life on the planet,Titans and giant dragons and they do a big ol\u2019 war evidenced by the arrow in the giant dragon and the titan skeletons\n\u2022Greater Will still conscious, sends Metyr as an emissary to mediate. This doesn\u2019t work. \n\n-Era of the Dragonlord\n\u2022Greater will decides to pick a side, picks dragons, sends a vassal in their image to act as Placidusax\u2019s god.\n\u2022Elden beast landing causes a cataclysm, molten flood, leaves damage on the divine towers, giants forge, anything built prior.\n\u2022Numen arrive in their arks (see T.A\u2019s flood theory)\n\u2022Giants begin to regress, some stay somewhat big, others evolve smaller but still venerate size, Rauh civilisation born.\n\u2022Numen diverge, three groups, Nox keep to their religion of the stars before the cataclysm, Ancient dynasty back their prophet Elden John in tree worship, shamans caught in between.\n\n-Era of the fallen dragon \n\u2022 Greater will becomes less and less conscious as it continues to break, still alive but more like the God head from Elder scrolls. Metyr puppets the Elden beast from this point\n\n\u2022Bayle discovers that the dragons are essentially subjects and rebels against subjugation\n\n\u2022Panicked by rebellion, Metyr withdraws the Elden beast whom appears to have just fled from Placidusax view\n\n\u2022 In his grief, Placid summons all his power as a time dragon and tried to freeze time before things get worse, he partially succeeds, freezing himself and taking most of Farum Azula with him.\n\n- Era of the Hornsent\n\n\u2022Cultures continue to develop and change, ancient dynasty and Rauh intermingle, creating a culture than venerates all the outer gods like the Rauh, but still craves a singular god again like the ancient dynasty. The Hornsent are born.\n\n\u2022Desperate for a god but without a greater will conscious enough to ask for one the Hornsent decide to make one themselves.\n\n\u2022They build the tower, and try to create a perfect vessel for the Elden Ring. As a problem seems to be that life is splitting smaller and smaller, it makes sense that to create godhood they should mulch a bunch of people together. Our shaman\u2019s, malleable in the same way that the Nox are with silver tears thanks to their common ancestor are the perfect base ingredient.\n\n\u2022Marika plays the role perfectly, becomes the perfect vassal and perfect wife for her Hornsent Elden Lord to be. But at the last moment, kills her betrothed and steals his threads of divinity herself. Betraying the Hornsent and becoming the one true god.\n\n-Era of the Marika wars\n\u2022 Marika begins her subjugation of the Lands Between\n\u2022Pays lip service to her large population of crucible loving people by taking Godfrey as her husband, crucible knights, arena, ect.\n\u2022Melina rebels, possibly learning the truth of how her mother comes to power and a civil war with her godskin nobles begins\n\u2022After felling the last of the fire giants and sealing away destined death, the wars are over and her age can begin proper\n\n-Era of the erdtree, the shattering ect.\n\u2022we know this era well so I won\u2019t go over it all again.\n\u2022One theory is that Marika knows that she corrupted the ritual. (See T.A\u2019s video about the ritual needing both husband and wife dead to truly ascend to godhood) So she sends out her Tarnished so that they might die and when the time is right, all be potential candidates for the shattering.\n\u2022 I believe Marika was 100% privy to the night of the black knives as it was a necessary part of her own plan, she doesn\u2019t care if Ranni\u2019s plan also works\n\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much most of it!\n\nI\u2019m missing a few things like the dragon siege of Leyndell, which I feel is motivated by the Dragons wanting the Elden beast back, realises that Marika and the beast are one now and consider the golden lineage kin from that point on, and loads of other things like that. But yeah, that\u2019s how I choose to reconcile the whole timeline and I hope it helps someone else to do the same!\n\n\n",

    "body": "Please tell me if some parts of the order of events here are contradictory or objectively in the wrong order. \n\nThe Beginning Era: \n\n\nThe Greater Will sends Metyr to the lands between via meteor. The first of many fingers - envoys to communicate with the Greater Will. \n\n\nThe Greater Will sends the Elden Beast on a golden meteor down to TLB. A Vassal of the Greater Will- it is the living form of the Elden Ring an artifact that guides the reality of TLB. \n\n\nThe Crucible exists in the lands between- described as a \u2018primordial form of the Erdtree\u2019 and the origin of life. It contains all aspects of biological life. Its red energy can corrupt beings into growing additional appendages, horns, wings and whatnot. The spiral is often an image used to represent the crucible - perhaps reminiscent of DNA strands? \n\n\nEra of Farum Azula: \n\n\nThe Ancient Dragons exist. They have extra teeth and wings, seemingly affected or newly created by the crucible. They wield red lightning reminiscent of the crucible. The beast men, who worship them build Faruum Azula. They have five fingers on their hands which they consider holy. \n\n\nDuring this time there is an Unknown person playing the Role of a God- Vessel to the Elden ring. Their Elden Lord and consort was the many headed dragon Placidusax. At some point the God of this Era Fled Farrum Azula. \n\n\nEra of the hornsent: \n\n\n(Note: there may be any number of eras that we can\u2019t place on this timeline that come before this one) \n\n\nIt is unknown whether the God of this era is the same one from Farum Azula or new one. At this time people resembling humans exist. The crucible is considered holy and rituals are performed to honor it. One of these rituals involves melding criminals together inside of a big pot to represent the abundance of biological parts represented in the crucible. \n\n\nHoly sights like the tower of the gate of divinity and the miracles of the time use the symbol of the spiral to pay homage to the crucible. \n\n\nA group of people called the Numens, live near the Hornspent. They are considered \u2018Shamans\u2019 and are considered a perfect material to help meld criminals together in pot rituals. \n\n\nAt this point in time the fingers have lost contact with the Greater Will, but they still pretend to act as envoys and control what they can. \n\n\nA Numen named Marika comes into contact with the Fingers and Hornsent Grandam. Marika is considered an Empyrean. She is assigned a shadow named Maleketh by the fingers. \n\n\nWhat Marika does next us considered \u2018a seduction and a betrayal\u2019 but she kills the God of this era - takes the Elden ring and preforms a ritual in Enir-Ilim to become a God herself. \n\n\nEra of the Erdtree: \n\n\nMarika creates the Erdtree and Scadurtree. Considering the description of the Erdtree being a future form of the crucible this likely involves manipulating the crucible in some way. \n\n\nMarika (with we don\u2019t know with who but my guess is Radagon) has her first Child, Messmer - who is unfortunately cursed by The Abyssal Serpent. She has another Child Melina, born at the base of the Erdtree. \n\n\nAnother empyrean named the Gloam-eyed Queen wields the power of the death rune through their black fire. Maleketh defeats the Gloam-eyed Queen and the rune of death is sealed away, outside of the Elden ring. This act creates the \u2018Golden Order\u2019 an era without destined death. \n\n\nThe era of the Golden Order: \n\n\nMarika makes Godfrey her lord consort and her first Elden Lord. \n\nMarika considered the fire of the Fel God held by the fire giants to be a threat to the Erdtree. She tasks the warrior Godfrey with defeating them and containing the fire which he does successfully. \n\n\n\nMarika and Godfrey  have three children together. Godwyn- and  Omen twins Morgott and Mohg. The Omen twins are \u2018cursed\u2019 by the crucible to have a multitude of horns growing from them. Marika hides her twins in the sewers under Lyndell. \n\nGodfrey at one point is in charge of the crucible knights but sometime during the age of the Golden order the aspects of the crucible are considered a curse and they are seen as distasteful. \n\nThe dragons of Farum Azula fight a war with the Golden order but are eventually defeated. Godwyn befriends one of the greatest of these dragons. \n\n\nThe Golden order then fights two wars with Caria- and their Queen Rennala. However Marika , as Radagon - marries Rennala and they become allies. Renalla and Radagon have three children, Rykard, Rani (an empyrean) and Rahdan. All are powerful sorcerers with Radagons red hair. \n\nGodfrey is exiled outside of TLB with the members of the round table. They become \u2018tarnished\u2019 no longer touched by grace. \n\nMarika sends her first son, Messmer on a crusade against the Hornsent. Rennala\u2019s sister, Rellana,  joins this crusade as Messmer\u2019s right hand. The crusade proves futile as Marika was using it to hide her sins and her son and she veils this area and it becomes known as \u2018the shadow realm\u2019 forgotten by almost everyone. \n\nRadagon leaves Rennala making her distraught. Radagon becomes Marika\u2019s second Elden Lord. They have a pair of twins Mequilla and Malenia, both are emperyans and cursed. Mequilla is cursed with eternal youth and Malenia is cursed by the outer god of rot. \n\n\n\nAge of the shattering: \n\nRanni, to escape her fate as an empyrean orchestrates the night of black knives- stealing a piece of destined death from Maleketh and having the royal assassins use it to destroy her body and the soul of Godwyn the Golden simultaneously. \n\nThis causes Marika to shatter the Eldin ring, and she is imprisoned in the Erdtree as punishment. \n\nThe ensuing war over the great runes is called the shattering- and the tarnished come back to free Marika from her imprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Elden Ring Timeline POST DLC\n\nSo the choice of Miquellas consort seems to be a heavily debated issue and the time line of events seems to still be ambiguous so I am going to give my take on what I think the timeline of events might be, I could b wrong and feel free to add any information or make any corrections to what I say, I feel I have a good grasp on the lore but I\u2019m no content creator by any means.\n\nThe Beginning:\nWe know that the greater will, one of the outer gods and the most prevelant and seemingly Influential in the lands between sent down the elden beast from the starts holding the elden Ring. In the DLC we actually learn that the mother of fingers, Meytr actually predates the Elden beast and was the first shooting star to be sent down to the lands between the mother of fingers who\u2019s used to convey the greater will. \n\nPrehistoric Age:\nIn this prehistoric age it was ruled by the ancient dragons (just like dark souls lmao) and the god of this era was unknown but the lord was placidusax. They ruled from Farum Azula which there\u2019s hits actually used to be connected to Caleid before it flew away. Either way Bayle betrayed Placidusax, brutally wounding himself and Placidusax before retreating. This betrayal also caused the birth of the other race of dragons since he is seemingly the first of this kind or the creator it seems. This also creates the act of dragon communion and the dragon hunters who hunt and kill dragons on behalf of their lord Placidusax in hope to hunt down and kill Bayle. They learn to consume the hearts of the lesser dragons to commune and obtain their power. Eventually this will result in transformation into dragon men and then eventually and wrym. Other cultures such as the hornscent, eternal cities, stormlands, badlands and the land of reeds grow and are undisturbed by the ancient dragons. At some time the god of the dragons disappeared and then Placidusax went beyond time to await his gods return, but his order of dragon hunters continued.\n\nMarika\u2019s rise:\nNow this is where it gets a bit confusing. Eventually Marika rose to power, an Numen Empyrean born in the lands that became the land of shadows which was probably attached to the lands between before it was split into the shadow realm. She is from the Shaman Village we can find which is said to be her home. Her along with her Two Fingers (Metyr) plot to take control. Marika betrays the god of this era in some fashion, killing them and taking godhood for herself at the gate of divinity. One possible god is the gloam eyed queen and her god skins whom Marika defeated with the use of her shadow Malekith, taking destined death from. In the DLC trailer it seems to depict the moment Marika ascended to god hood at the gate of divinity at bellurat tower. The body she takes the golden threads, likely the remains of the elden ring.\n\nOne theory of who this is is GEQ\u2019s body we see. This is all speculation but regardless Marika establishes her new order, that of healing and peace and plants what would become the erdtree however this does not last. Her Shaman village is destroyed and her people murdered and this seems to likely be the turning point from Marika being a god a healing into a god of wrath and instead creates her Golden Order and removes the rune or death from the elden ring and embues into Malekith\u2019s black blade. And begins her deadly crusade. Lyendell capital is established sometime after or maybe even before and her war with the fire giants and ancient dragons who no longer have a lord begin.\n\nIdentity of Messmer and Melina:\nNow for the identity of Messmer and Melina. There are so many possibility\u2019s here and I honestly bounce between them. Brother and sister who are both cursed with fire. Messmer is said to have been \u201clike an older brother to Radahn\u201d along with commander Giaus whom he learned gravitational magic with. So this brings into question the birth of Messmer and his younger sister Melina. \n1. Either Messmer and Melina are the forgotten children of by Marika and Godfrey\n2. Marika and Radagon consummated them both before their marriage \n3. Marika/Radagon and the GEQ. This theory with the GEQ would explain why both siblings are cursed with fire and why Melina has the one shut gloam eye and Messmer also has a shut eye harboring the abyssal serpent. Or perhaps Melina is the GEQ HERSELF and the godskins war was Melina rebelling against her erdtree during Marikas Vengeful crusade. \n4. Marika and the Fell God/their lord are the parents\nAll these theories have some merit and it is unclear which is the most likely as of now so I thought it\u2019d include them. \n\nMarika and Messmers Crusade:\nMarika perhaps in response to her home being destroyed and her people killed returns home, bathes it in gold to heal but nobody is left to heal\u2026 this is her last act as a god of gold and becomes one of wrath and fury. At some time either after establishing her new Golden Order or prior takes Godfrey, known as Horah Loux the Chieftain of the badlands a vicious barbaric warrior as her consort and places the leader of beasts Serosh on his back to hold back his blood thirst so he can be a proper lord, their first child is Godwyn. They begin a holy crusade and purge the lands of all that are considered blasphemous to her new reign, Godfrey wages war in the north, and radagon waged war in the south. \n\nRadagon, Marikas other half becomes a renowned warrior in the war and ends the conflict with Liurnia by marrying their queen Renalla. They father three children Rykard, Radahn, and Ranni. While the war is waging Messmer becomes an older brother figure to Radahn who begins his stewardship under the onyx lord along with Gaius. \n\nNot long after sends Messmer and the most Erdtree faithful, basically fanatics, to destroy the Hornscent people, most likely for the destruction of her village which she perhaps blames them for. Killing and burning nearly everything with the use of his Fire knights and Furnace Golems. Messmer kills nearly all of the Hornscent divine dancing dragons, skewering them on his spears for all to see in the flames. Romina, a leader of a church likely devoted to the god of the hornscent is a victim of this crusade, her church and body burnt she convenes with the outergod of rot. Resulting in her transformation and she creates the Rot Religion. \n\nGodfrey and his crucible knights, probably from the land of shadow, wage war in the north kill all the fire giants except for one who is cursed to tend to the forge. Godfrey also kills the storm lord. Messmer may have also played a role in this explaining why the bodies of the giants are impaled. During this time they also fight the ancient dragons and which gransaxx whom invades the capital. It is likely that Godwyn the golden was the one who slew the great dragon and eventually there was a truce between the two factions due to the friendship between fortissax and Godwyn. The dragons teach Godwyn and order how to wield lightning and create the order of the Ancient Dragon Cult and Godwyns Dragon Knights. \n\nNow if we take into consideration taht Melina is the GEQ then GEQ and her godskins seeing the atrocities Marika has enacted rebels against Marika trying to supplant her rule with her own. However she is defeated by Malekith and her role as the weilder of destined death is taken and sealed into Malekiths black blade and her gloam eye is shut so long as the rune is sealed. If we think GEQ is its own person this event likely predates her crusade, being the ascension of her godhood or occurs sometime during the crusade.\n\nOnce the fire giants are destroyed the Erdtree finally in full effect (representing her Order) and the Scadutree its shadow which is devoid of order also forms. This also splits the land of shadow from the lands between. Perhaps out of fear or shame for what Messmer to the Hornscent, not wanting those she will rule know what she enacted he is cut off and trapped in the now Lands of Shadow left to rule. All that do not fit in her Golden order are sent to the Shadow Realm, where Messmer rules and guards the gate of divinity. Twin omens Morgott and Mohg are born, likely as a curse enacted by the omen god on queen Marika. As a result they are shunned to live under the capital, where omens are hidden from sight. Fighting continues for some time as Godfrey remains elden lord and the Demi gods continue to grow up, radahn in particular grows to idolize Godfrey the most along with his father Radagon. After all the fighting is over and the last enemy is defeated the grace of gold leaves the tarnished and their leader Godfrey and they are banished from the lands between.\n\nThe Age of the Erdtree:\nMarika is now unchallenged, enemies defeated or sent to her jail the realm of shadow where all things that do not have a place are stored. She takes Radagon as her second Elden Lord. They consummate two emperean twins Miquella and Melenia both who are cursed. Miquella who will forever be young and Melenia who harbors the scarlet rot inside her. Both likely results of curses enacted by her victims. Her children and step children all are now demigods. Rykard becomes the Praetor and is awarded ownership of the volcano manor (basically becomes their torturer for any info for those in defiance to the golden order) miquella begins trying to cure his sister, Ranni begins her destain for the greater will and rykard eventually finds the secrets of the volcano manor. Miquella in his quest to cure his sister leaves golden order fundamentalism despite help from his father, eventually creating his Haligtree and creation of unalloyed gold. During this era Miquella who seems to be the one most destined to become a god among the Emperyan children is promised that Radahn will be his consort when his ascension to godhood occurs. Radahn is chosen not only chosen due to being powerful and a renowned warrior like Godfrey, but more importantly honorable and kind which miquella holds important above all else.  \n\nNight of the black knives:\nRanni enacts her plot to steal the run of death from Malekith and with her black knives sneak into the capital and kill Godwyn\u2019s soul and simultaneously killing her body releasing the influence of the greater will on her. This plan was likely aided by Rykard who also began worshipping the serpent under volcano manor and probably had soemthing to do with the black knives getting into the capital. He was awarded with the blasphemous claw so he could fight off Malekith If Marika ever discovered his role.\n\nThe Shattering:\nWith the death of Godwyn, probably the most beloved of the demigods breaks Marika. Marika who sealed the rune of death out of sorrow for what happened to her home and the catalyst likely for her change from a benevolent god to one of wrath us once again. This time instead of a deadly crusade she grows distain for the greater will and subsequently in her grief enters the erdtree and shatters to elden ring in an act of defiance. Radagon, ever loyal to the greater will attempts to mend the rune but is too late and their body since it is the vessel of the ring itself becomes shattered itself. The greater will traps Marika into the Erdtree, crucifying her and the shattering war ensues. The demigods fight for lordship over the great runes. The twin omens Morgott and Mohg escape captivity below the capital. Mohg during his time in the sewers conversed with the formless mother and saw visions of the Moghwyn Dynasty. As a result retreated to Moghwyn palace deep underground. Morgott disguised as Margit the fell omen leads the capital and golden order in this war with his black nights. Fighting against both mount gelmir and liurnia. Rykard retreat\u2019s to the depth of the volcano manor and lets himself be devoured by the serpent. Most of his army leaves his service and the battle is mostly over. Godrick also takes root in stormveil castle. Miquella cocoons into the haligtree and Melenia heads to Cailed to retrieve radahn so he upholds his vow to be miquellas consort. He seems to perhaps go against his vow, taking a great rune for himself perhaps wanting to uphold the golden order his father and role model Godfrey helped create rather than serve Miquellas new order. A battle ensues and melenia to meet radahns measure (probably hoping to kill him) releases the scarlet Aeonia and devastes the entire continent of the Calid wilds. Radahn however survives but becomes a beast and wonders aimlessly. Melenia is returned to the haligtree and mogh kidnaps Miquella wanting to be his consort. Mohg knowing he himself cannot become a god wishes to use Miquella as the god of his new age with the formless mother which he will control.\n\nMiquellas plan:\nMiquella however likely knows this and manipulates these events to have mogh use his accursed omen blood to allow himself to enter the land of shadows where he knows he can divest his flesh, even his great rune which is absorbed into the scadutree, separates himself from his female half saint Trina and accesses the gate or divinity to become a god and access radahn\u2019s soul which will be sent to the scadutree upon death. He plans to use moghs body as a vessel for radahns soul which will be in the likeness of his younger self which Miquella held in great regard.\n\nStart of the Game and DLC:\nThe shattering continues, the tarnished collects the great runes, kills radahn sending his soul to the scadutree where miquella is and kills Mohg. Mogh\u2019s body is brought to the land of shadow and the tarnished unlock the gate of divinity and Miquella resurrected radahn with the use of mogh body. Throughout the DLC Miquella uses us for his own gain bc this is all for the lgreater good\u201d in his eyes. He knows our power and ability and that we are probably the tarnished likely to brandish the elden ring. Our final test is to defeat his most trusted soldiers. After their defeat he knows there\u2019s no other option but to defeat us and get rid of the last possivle obstacle to his age of compassion. Radahn initially seems like a puppet without his soul, in phase two his soul seems to return finally, the red fire indicates this as well as miquellas arrival and dialogue. Miquella finally takes him as his lord consort as he has now ascended to godhood. They fight the tarnished who is now the last obstacle upholding the old order of the Golden Order or any other order the transfer choses to side with. We sadly have no place in miquellas order. He chose Radahn as his consort, not us and due to our power we are probably to much of a treat to let live. There is acc a death in the fight which Miquella \u201ctakes our heart\u201d and we bend our knee to him. This seems to be the only way we survive in Miquellas order, as a brainwashed puppet for miquella to use. The tarnished however win this takes place before the end of the base game, the tarnished however ofc defeat them and then the remaining of the base game continues however ending the player chooses. Miquella is more similar to Marika then he realizes, he uses others for his own gain for what he believes to be for the best just like Marika did. Miquella is ultimately in my mind a naive child who believes he knows best and that all the world needs is love and compassion and eveeythinv will be fine and the world will be fixed. This however is unlikely, the horrors enacted by Marika cannot be forgotten and he is ultimately destined to fail. The tarnished win and the rest of the game ensues to whichever ending we decide. I\u2019m not sure if there is an alternate ending however but if anyone knows plz share.\n\nI know that was a lot and not completely comprehensive or 100% correct. Hope y\u2019all enjoyed the read and hope it helps understand what I think is the important lore.",

    "body": "For everyone who is disappointed by the lack of Godwyn in the DLC, I feel for you. However, feel consoled with the knowledge that his small presence in the Shadow Lands is perhaps the key to understanding the timeline.\n\nThe veiling of the Lands of Shadow must take place after Godwyn\u2019s death, and before the Shattering. \n\n*These knights, once Godwyn's personal guard, quested to find their transfigured master's cadaver surrogate\u2014for the coming age of the Duskborn.*\n\n*When the Elden Ring was shattered, the people of the realm of shadow felt it too\u2014and feared it as a sign of the Erdtree's wrath.*\n\nThe Lands of Shadow felt it *too* would only be emphasized if there was some reason why one might assume the LoS would not have felt it - a reasonable assumption if it is veiled away. \n\nThe period between Godwyn\u2019s death and the Shattering is a fascinating part of the general Elden Ring timeline that we know very little about, but now we can get some answers. Firstly, it seems Marika decided to begin the crusade after Godwyn\u2019s death - an interesting detail, considering my image of Marika after his death was basically only of grief leading to the Shattering.\n\nIn terms of the veiling\u2019s timeline in relation to the crusade, it seems as though the veiling of the spiral tower and the veiling of the Shadow Lands in general were possibly the same event? The Belurat Grandam says Messmer burned Belurat and *then* veiled the tower.\n\n*\u201dOur lands were by thy kind set aflame, our tower by thy kind veiled in shadow.\u201d*\n\n(This point has been disproven by the fact that when we burn the sealing tree, the lands remain veiled)\n\nI see a lot of folks speculating that Marika veiled the Lands of Shadow at the very start of her Godhood, or that it has to have been before Rennala went mad, but I don\u2019t see how to reconcile the Death Knight descriptions with any other timeline besides \u201cthey teleported to the Shadow Lands lol\u201d\n\nPlease prove me wrong, but if this seems correct, let\u2019s keep this in mind when theorycrafting a timeline, or, more importantly, figuring out where the Lands of Shadow were located originally.\n\nEDIT\n\nTo the folks suggesting that people can get to The Land of Shadow independent of Miquella, I would firstly point out that there is zero evidence not only for an alternate method of transportation, but there\u2019s isn\u2019t even evidence for this occurring. Secondly;\n\nShadow Rune\n*In a long-forgotten place where none would tread, the light of grace quietly grew ever more brilliant.*\n\nThe menu narrator, whose facts are to be taken as inherently true, tells us nobody has been here after the veiling. \n",

    "body": "So most people seem to agree now that Messmer's crusade must have happened after Godfrey was divested of grace, as Messmer's dialogue shows that he knows what a tarnished is. This always seemed a bit odd to me, as Godfrey is still a revered figure in the Shadow Lands, with Messmer's soldiers fighting in his style and even some using crucible spells.\n\n*Mother, wouldst thou truly Lordship sanction, in one so bereft of light?*\n\nThe thing is, Messmer doesn't only know what a tarnished is. He also knows that Marika has extended grace to them so they are also allowed to become Lords, and this only happened after the Shattering War. If we followed the same logic to conclude the crusade happened after Godfrey's departure, this would also have to mean that it happened *after* the Shattering, and that's pretty much impossible.\n\nFrom the Wrath from Afar incantation, we know that the Shattering was also felt in the Shadow Lands, so it's not like it's completely disconnected from the Land Betweens. I think *hidden* is the more correct term to refer to the Shadow Lands.\n\nSo here's my theory: Messmer still had some form of communication with the rest of the Lands Between from the Shadow Lands, even if it was for receiving messages only. In fact, I believe that he *must* have had some communication with the outer world, as he wouldn't know that tarnished are allowed to become Elden Lord otherwise. So when the tarnished were called back to the Lands Between for the chance of becoming Elden Lord, Messmer was also made aware of this somehow. Also, the way Messmer is surprised about us being tarnished makes me think this is the first time he's seen one, as he isn't even completely sure that we are in fact tarnished. This opens up the possibility for the Crusade to have happened in the later part of Godfrey's reign, which makes a lot more sense in my opinion.",

    "body": "One thing that has me bothered is the timeline of events, specially around Miquella and his actions up to entering the Land of Shadow\n\nHere is the stuff I think happened for sure in order:\n\n1. Miquella and Malenia were chilling among their demigod siblings during Marika's rule. Miquella was close with Radagon and got into fundamentalism, gifting him spells he came up with: Discus of Light and Triple Rings of Light. In return, Radagon gifted Miquella Radagon's Rings of Light in gratitude. \n\n2. Miquella was trying to find ways to cure Malenia of her rot. He realized that fundamentalism could not cure Malenia, so he eventually turned from it. Per Radagon's Rings of Light description: *And yet, the young Miquella abandoned fundamentalism, for it could do nothing to treat Malenia's accursed rot. This was the beginning of unalloyed gold.*\n\n3. Using and mastering unalloyed gold, Miquella became crafting tools to slow down Malenia's rot, including unalloyed needles and prosthetics. It might even be around this time that Miquella learned to compel others, per the description of the bewitching branch: *Tree branch blessed with an incantation of unalloyed gold.  However, this is merely speculation, and perhaps he already knew.* \n\n4. The Shattering War happened. All hell broke lose. Miquella and Malenia received their Great Runes. Eventually, Malenia would march to Caelid and battle Radahn in one last epic clash. This ended with Malenia unconscious, and Radahn stricken with rot and driven mad. Miquella apparently marched with Malenia, since he was there too. Per Freyja's words: *I was left behind, and only Kindly Miquella was good enough to seek me out.*\n\n5. Miquella returned to the Haligtree and cocooned himself. Mohg came and kidnapped him from the tree and began all his blood magic on him. \n\nStuff that apparently happened but has no hard timeframe:\n\n* At some point, Miquella and Radahn had a conversation and a vow was made between them. When? \n* Miquella's powers of bewitching seem that he must be able to get close to you in order to do so. Which means, he had to get close to Mohg and his knight in order to bewitch them. Ummm... when and how? Did he venture into the sewers to get to Mohg? How long was be bewitch? It had to be long enough for this knight to notice and attempt to challenge Miquella. And when he decide to use Mohg? Long before the Shattering? Or after? And WHY Mohg? How did Miquella keep his flesh in the Land of Shadow but also leave behind his body in Mohg's palace? \n* When exactly was the Haligtree made? We know Miquella watered it with his own blood since it was a sapling, and before the dlc it was assumed it was made so that Miquella would ascend to godhood. But that doesn't seem to be the case? And if so, why bother using a cocoon at all and making a whole show about getting kidnapped?",

    "body": "# Introduction\n\nSotE has been an absolute blast, but the ending poses more questions than it does answers. Upon my own completion of the DLC, I have begun an arduous quest to read between the lines. There's plenty of item descriptions hinting at what we already know, as well as some things we don't. New areas in particular have illuminated the more obscure parts of the lore and I feel like some of the answers we've been searching for are now ripe for speculation. The following accounts are my trail of logic and theory, beginning at the end and working backwards through the Realm of Shadow. Be warned. Major spoilers ahead.\n\n# Part I: Marika's Great Rune\n\nThe Gate of Divinity is, without a doubt, my favorite addition to the greater Elden Ring lore. One thing we know for certain is that the Gate of Divinity is atop\u00a0*Belurat, Tower Settlement*\u00a0in a sacred ground called\u00a0*Enir-Ilim*. Based on the horned iconography of these areas, I'd like to make the assumption that both Belurat and Enir-Ilim are constructions of the Hornsent. How about the Gate of Divinity? Did the Hornset also construct that? I'm not sure, but I believe I know how it came to be. More on that in a bit.\n\nAt the Gate of Divinity we witness a resurrection of sorts with Radahn and the emergence of a deity with Miquella. Would it be a far stretch to imagine that this is the very same place where Marika became a vassal of the Greater Will? I believe SotE's Story Trailer reveals a sequence at the Gate of Divinity that is deeply symbolic with Marika as a progenitor and goddess. Below is my analysis.\n\n[SotE Story Trailer - Marika's Sequence](https://preview.redd.it/u564rwwvhw8d1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ee9b87416640101c5efc7324c1e9b623df257fe)\n\nShot 1. An arm belonging to Marika (we know this because of her bracelet (not pictured)) pulls what appears to be golden threads from a corpse. I'm mentioning this because in the Elden Ring announcement trailer we see similar threads emanating from\u00a0*Marika's Hammer*, which both shattered and amended the Elden Ring. Additionally, splitters of the Elden Ring can be seen on the hammer in-game. It should also be noted that in this shot we can see a bunch of red flesh in the background.\n\nShot 2. Marika walks through a bunch of flesh towards a light, which in context of this sequence, is definitely the Gate of Divinity.\n\nShot 3. Marika holds the golden threads aloft in gesture that is very reminiscent of Marika's icon and what is likely Marika's Great Rune. It is plausible that is golden essence is the same material as the Elden Ring, but this is currently just speculation. Following this gesture, a strong wind flows through the Gate of Divinity and into wherever Marika is. My guess is Enir-Ilim.\n\nShot 4. Cut to an establishing shot. Marika is most certainly standing at the Gate of Divinity.\n\nI'd like to take a moment to dissect the appearance of the Gate of Divinity in the actual game.\n\n[The Gate of Divinity](https://preview.redd.it/sxqamcn3iw8d1.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1448f0a0331f08386570e43ade9999e94ba8c2a)\n\nNotice how it's not fleshy and red as we see in the Story Trailer, but rather stony and disintegrating. I'd also like to point out that the actual gate itself us shaped like Marika's great rune, but I feel like that may just be a fun, thematic coincidence.\n\nNow, the reason I keep mentioning Marika's great rune is because the sequence in the Story Trailer evokes a powerful moment noteworthy enough to animate. To discern what could be happening here, I'd like to bring your attention to the\u00a0*Tower of Shadow Message.*\n\n&gt;*Message left by Needle Knight Leda, addressed to kindred spirits who also pursue Miquella's trail. \"The Gate of Divinity lies in the tower sealed by shadow. That is surely where Kind Miquella is headed. We are no Empyreans, but we must locate the path that will lead us there. I will follow the crosses east.\"*\n\nThe context of this note is clear, to me at least; the Gate of Divinity is where Empyreans like Marika and Miquella go to ascend to godhood. The gate is most definitely a portal to somewhere that lies even beyond the Realm of Shadow. It could be an afterlife perhaps, or some kind of divine realm. Who's to say.\n\nWhat I can say with some more certainty is that the Gate of Divinity is made out of corpses.\n\n[Hornsent Corpses in the Gate of Divinity Boss Arena](https://preview.redd.it/ti2i5p1diw8d1.jpg?width=682&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9adb939f44a3cc147ad18a5a766e5002e529f063)\n\nRemember the red flesh in the Story Trailer? Yeah, gruesome stuff. This next theory is a bit of a tangent, but check out the item description for\u00a0*Sacred Bloody Flesh*.\n\n&gt;*Raw meat soaked with blood.*  \n*A delicacy of the bloodfiends.*\n\n&gt;*Temporarily boosts physical attack power and arcane.*  \n*When blood loss occurs nearby, further boosts attack power.*\n\n&gt;*The blood is said to have fallen from the Formless Mother's wound. Never will it dry, never will it rot.*\n\nBased on the context here, could it be possible that the corpse we see in the Story Trailer belongs to the Formless Mother? How formless is she really? Also, for those of you unaware, the Formless Mother is just another name for the Mother of Truth (the deity that Mohg draws power from). Additionally, I'd like to point out that Mohg only witnessed the influence of the Formless Mother after his own horn grew into his eye. Thematic coincidence? Maybe. It definitely feels like the Omen curse has something to do with the Hornsent.\n\nBack to main theory, I'd like to bring up Marika's great rune again. As we know, Marika's great rune is similar to the rune of death (AKA destined death), but the arch on Marika's rune in upturned, almost as if Marika's rune is just an inverted rune of death. I've seen a lot of speculation on the actual purpose of Marika's rune, but my favorite theory is that it represents the absence of death in the lands between. The only violation of this being the death of Godwyn at the hands of the Black Knight Assassins, which of course, lead to The Shattering. Could it be that the moment we witness in the Story Trailer is not only the ascension of Marika, but also the amendment of the rune of death? We'll have to wait on more discoveries on this particular theory, but if the SotE alludes to anything, it's that this moment we see in the Story Trailer is most certainly Marika's \"Original Sin,\" whatever that entails. The Story Trailer also refers to this moment as \"The Beginning.\" Leading me to believe that the original sin IS the beginning AND it happened at the Gate of Divinity.\n\n# Part II: The Crucible\n\nWhat is the Crucible really, and what does it have to do with Marika? I've seen this topic thrown around a lot, but I think the following item descriptions may be able to summarize this quickly.\n\nAspects of the Crucible: Breath\n\n&gt;*One of the ancient Erdtree incantations.*\n\n&gt;*Creates a throat pouch on the caster's neck, allowing them to spew*  \n*fiery breath while walking.*  \n*Charging increases duration of the breath.*\n\n&gt;*This is a manifestation of the Erdtree's primal vital energies - an*  \n*Aspects of the primordial crucible, where all life was once blended*  \n*together.*\n\nCrucible Tree Armor\n\n&gt;*Armor of the Crucible Knights who served Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.*\n\n&gt;*Worn by the knight Siluria and her men.*\n\n&gt;*Holds the power of the crucible of life, the primordial form of the Erdtree. Strengthens Aspects of the Crucible incantations.*\n\nSiluria's Tree\n\n&gt;*Siluria's Tree, weapon of one of the two honored as foremost among the Crucible Knights.*\n\n&gt;*The primordial form of the Erdtree is close in nature to life itself, and this spear, modeled on its crucible, is imbued with ancient holy essence.*\n\nSo we know that Crucible is close to nature itself, looks like a tree or maybe horns, is a primordial form of the Erdtree, and was where all life was once blended together. We also know that the chaos of the Crucible stands in direct opposition to Marika's (or the Greater Will's) ideas of order. Maybe the Crucible is an actual place, but maybe it's not. In a post by\u00a0u/TheBlaringBlue, they suggest that the Crucible is simply the process of evolution free from influence. I've seen others like\u00a0u/WorriedCtzn\u00a0liken the Crucible to a primordial, tree-like Elden Ring. It could also be an infliction or growth similar to what we see with the Omens. SotE, however, adds a VERY interesting NPC to the game: a lone Crucible Knight in the\u00a0*Ruins of Rauh*. Here's the description for their *Crucible Hammer-Helm*.\n\n&gt;*Helm worn by Devonia, longest-serving of the Crucible Knights. Holds the power of the crucible of life, the primordial form of the Erdtree. Strengthens Aspects of the Crucible incantations. It is said Devonia quested in search of the Crucible's origin, and departed from the lands of the Erdtree alone.*\n\nAccording to this item \"The Crucible of Life\" is also \"The Primordial Form of the Erdtree\" AND likely originates somewhere in the Realm of Shadow close to or within the Ruins of Rauh.\n\nAs a fun little exercise I followed the gaze of Devonia westward across the broken bridge. The view includes the western plateau as well as Ener-Ilim. I also followed the headwaters of the river in this area. Did you know that the waterways in the Ruins of Rauh are the headwaters for the entire Realm of Shadow? Pretty cool, huh. Anyways, the upper most pool has a gazebo with an item within called *Rauh Burrow*.\n\n&gt;*Oval-shaped stone bearing an engraving. Material used for crafting items. Relic found at the ancient ruins of Rauh. In the center of the stone is a small nest-like hole. Once this is inhabited by a sprite, the stone can be used as a ritual implement.*\n\nWeird isn't it? This item is related to several others via crafting. Like the\u00a0*Beast Horn*, which is extraordinarily useful for discussing the Crucible.\n\n&gt;*Horn suffused with spirituality. Material used for crafting items. Found by hunting horned beasts of the realm of shadow. The Crucible has a particularly strong influence on the beasts of the realm of shadow, causing many to grow horns despite the characteristics of their species.*\n\nParticularly strong you say? This description accompanied with the notion of Devonia's quest seems to suggest that the Crucible, or it's place of origin, are within the Realm of Shadow.\n\n# Part 3: The Hornsent\n\nThe Hornsent are products of the Crucible. This is evident in their iconography which diefies horns. Look no further than the\u00a0*Divine Beast Dancing Lion*\u00a0boss. The\u00a0*Enraged Divine Beast*\u00a0talisman describes these warriors as, \"messengers of the heavens\" and connect their authority to stormy weather. This kind of reminds me of the ancient dragons and the perpetual storm at\u00a0*Crumbling Farum Azula;*\u00a0chaotic and antagonistic compared to the Erdtree.\n\nSo, if the Hornsent worship horns and storms, then would it be a stretch to assume that they also worshiped, or at least tolerated, the Crucible? They are certainly products of it, receiving the wrath of Messmer's inquisition and all that.\n\nCrucible aside, I'd like to talk about\u00a0*Belurat Goal*\u00a0and all the awful things therein. The entire place is a prison for soon-to-be warrior jars or as the Hornsent wanted, saints. Marika's hometown, the\u00a0*Shaman Village*, had trouble with the Hornset is seems, as the scene at\u00a0*Bonny Town*\u00a0suggest the abduction and prosecution of her countrymen. The shamans were tortured until they bled profusely and forced into jars in a disturbing ritualistic practice. Have a look at the *Tooth Whip*.\n\n&gt;*Whip bestrewn with rotting, misshapen teeth. Filthy and seething with disease, the teeth are embedded in the whip and dose the victim with deadly poison upon each strike. As the wounds ripen they grow inflamed and ooze pus. The flesh of shamans was said to meld harmoniously with others.*\n\nNow back to Marika. The impact crater outside of the Shaman Village heavily suggests that a vassal of the Greater Will, likely\u00a0*Metyr*, communed with Marika and set her on the path of revenge or greatness. Probably both, as Marika eventually finds herself at the Gate of Divinity with a great rune.\n\nSpeaking of, let's revisit the Gate of Divinity with some renewed context. Here's what we know.\n\n1. The Gate of Divinity is sacred place where Empyreans ascend into godhood.\n2. The Hornsent worshiped or tolerated the Crucible wherein \"all life was once blended together.\"\n3. The Hornset learned that they could fuse Shamans/Numens into amalgamations of flesh for the purposes of creating a saint.\n\nMakes you wonder how the Gate of Divinity came to be, doesn't it? Allow me to propose theory regarding how it was created:\n\n\\*cough\\*\u00a0TLDR\n\n**The Hornset constructed the Gate of Divinity by fusing together shamans, AKA the Numen, because they have a sensitivity to the presence of outer gods.**\n\nDoes this process seem familiar? I bet it does. This precisely what happens throughout the many catacombs of the Lands Between. Only, Marika's version is called *Erdtree Burial*.\n\nAlso, now would be a good time to bring up the formless mother again, also called the Mother of Truth. What truth, I wonder? And that whole blood motif kinda fits in well with this theory, even if it is a bit of a stretch.\n\nOverall, I have a feeling that the original sin has a lot to do with the unethical creation of the Gate of Divinity. That, and how close the Hornsent are to the Crucible. But that's just a theory! A game theory. Thanks for reading.\n\n(Re-upload cause I'm dumb).",
