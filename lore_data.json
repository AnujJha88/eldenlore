Both bosses have similar lore, since they are both born from the accumulation of a mass of dead organisms.\n\nIn the Scholar\u2019s quest we discover that he is an albinauric and that he wants to find the purifying tear to cure his illness, which he ultimately fails to do. But his mission is not useless, since with the purifying tear he manages to purify the Dreg Lord.\nAfter purifying the Dreg Lord, he gets from it the same circlet that the old albinaurics wear. This connects the Dreg lord with the albinaurics. \n\n Finally, to connect the Scholar with Elden John, his dawn skin is very similar to Elden John\u2019s, who I believe was the God of another era, and on his hat we see a depiction of the Elden Ring. Even the solver tears and the Putrescence masses are very similar.\n\nThe Cerulian Coast is full of stone coffins, but unlike the fissure, these don\u2019t have a drop of putrescence coming out of them.

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "A speculative analysis of why we have these guys as Night Bosses; + more. \n\nThis selection was arbitrarily selected. \n\nI include the Dark Souls bosses, not because they\u2019re connected, but because there are thematic similarities between them and the Night Lords they fight for, same as the other Night Bosses. \n\n//////////////////\n\nWormface\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nWormfaces are an odd choice for Night Boss since they seem like they would mind their own business. Wormfaces are found in the misty woods of the Altus Plateau as well as an off-road section of Farum Azula, hiding away from attack or judgement (should be noted that Farum Azula\u2019s Deathblight may be present in the city because the city was on land long enough for the contaminate to spread; Farum Azula may\u2019ve lifted off during the Shattering; a Draconic Sentinel and Leyndell Dragon Cult Prayerbook can be found here). The Night does provoke violence as seen with Revenant\u2019s family, though most of the foes in Limveld already have cause to kill us. \n\nAbout Wormfaces themselves, their namesake is pretty obvious, but may be the result of Spontaneous Generation (an archaic belief that pests form from mud and rot) something we see when afflicted with Deathblight as flies burst from our flesh. The Wormfaces are also deformed body-wise and seem to have grown excessively as I have not seen people of the Erdtree grow to such heights; they could be suffering excess growth like Godwyn. They could be an entirely different race of people who transformed. \n\nIt should also be noted that they\u2019re resistant to Holy damage, possibly because Deathblight is a living energy as it sources from Godwyn, an undying body. Holy, to me, must be some kind of life energy as it is emitted by the Elden Beast and the Demigods are all resistant to it (Runes are life and Marika became a God via a mass sacrifice). \n\nThe file name for the Wormfaces is \u201cDeracine\u201d, meaning \u201cuprooted\u201d, perhaps revealing some insight into Miyazaki as he would release a VR game by that title in 2018. It doesn\u2019t explain much however. I think the name means these are dead people who have been resurrected, but unlike Those Who Live In Death, rather I think they\u2019re closer to Godwyn\u2019s affliction, though there is still questions. What makes the difference between afflictions? Those Who Live In Death are in contact with Deathroot which spread through the Erdtree\u2019s roots. The only remaining explanation to me is that these Deracine intentionally infected themselves. \n\nThe minions the Wormfaces summons aren\u2019t too special. They\u2019re rats, slugs, disheveled corpses, and Deathblighted Crabs. \n\nThis boss is summoned in expeditions against Adel, Maris, and Caligo. Why? I\u2019ll ponder some possibilities. \n\nAdel and Caligo are both dragons, different kinds, but similar enough; one is a lightning-wielding Drake and the other is an Ancient Dragon without lightning. Godwyn was a founder of the Capital\u2019s Dragon Cult which worshipped the Ancient Dragons and wielded lightning. The Wormfaces are found in areas that could potentially be associated with Godwyn; the Altus Plateau, which was his home, and Farum Azula, city of the Ancient Dragons; this Godwyn connection could be the (developer-wise) reason they were selected to protect the dragon Night Lords. \n\nMaris is more esoterical as Maris is a sorcerous being, dealing magic and sleep. Magic is residual life energy, as described by Sellen when talking of Glintstone; and as seen with Ghostflame and Dwelling Arrows. Sleep is also associated with death as seen through St. Trina who was dropped into the Coffins Fissure, her nectar (and Thiollier\u2019s potion) dealing death, and her surroundings being melted corpse matter. Water is also associated with death as seen with Godwyn\u2019s fishy design, the waterfall coffins, and Tibia Mariners; the colossal stone coffins are found on a coast and the fissure is below the sea surface. Maris is a spiritual being so I think a deathly Wormface fits for her expedition\u2019s first night in a thematic sense. \n\n/////////////////////////\n\nGaping Dragon\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nAn easy choice and comparative figure to Adel, hence its inclusion on his first nights. The Gaping Dragon has an inverse of Adel\u2019s strength and weakness (it\u2019s immune to poison and weak to lightning, whilst Adel is weakened by poison and resistant to lightning). The Gaping Dragon eats sewage pouring down from Lordran\u2019s cities, so it must be pretty used to poison; its weakness to lightning is a symptom of its heritage as a descendant of Dark Souls\u2019 Ancient Dragons who had scales of stone and lived in the Age before disparity, lightning in that universe being sunlight, a force that distinguishes and changes, thus the Ancient Dragons were weak to it since they embodied stasis and lack of change (think of it like how flowing water washes away rot). \n\nAdel is a Lightning Drake of some kind, unlike anything we\u2019ve seen. The Ancient Dragons of Elden Ring contain Gold in their flesh which allows their conduction of lightning, their flesh being stony as well, but resistant to lightning due to their affinity; the drakes on the other hand are less stony in composition. Bayle is able to conjure lightning and somewhat resembles an Ancient dragon given his stonier flesh; his mountain-bound kin also wield lightning. Adel\u2019s flesh is desiccated and it\u2019s hard to judge its composition. Adel is actually a great mystery to me. Drakes are never referred to as \u201cprehistoric\u201d like the ancients are, so why is Adel a Dino? \n\n(This below paragraph is 64% nonsense, viewer discretion is advised)\n\n(Headcanon I made up because I love Adel and I will make up anything to boast of his primacy) The Crucible causes devolution so perhaps Adel is actually an ancient dragon ancestor and the drakes are just a return to the original form of dragons? (\ud83e\udd26 this literally doesn\u2019t matter and jumps over a wall, not even a hurdle). His lightning is so weird too. Purple? Not gravity\u2026 perhaps gravity adjacent because dragons also have a unique stone-based weakness, drop Smithing Stones, and also conduct electricity; basically, what if dragons are descendants of meteoric beasts? I\u2019ve also pondered purple gold (I\u2019m being for real) which is possible at a nanoscale when gold is compressed and light scatters through it in weird ways\u2026 Night-tinged lightning makes more apparent sense though as Adel is a Night Lord and the Night is very blue and purple. \n\nAnyways, he is prone to vomiting from poison. I suspect it\u2019s due to his excessive eating as he is a gluttonous devourer; poison makes him sick and he is forced to vomit the contents of his stomach to reject it.\n\nBoth dragons are devourers, the Gaping Dragon eating souls and becoming mostly mouth in an effort to eat as much as possible (don\u2019t remember which Miyazaki interview it was said in but it was said). It was influenced by disparity, the power of souls, and hungered after them to obtain more strength, much like the undead of that setting. Adel was starved by the Night as it killed his prey and forced him to adapt to its new world, thus he seems in rough shape, bearing injured skin, excess teeth, and his hunger. He snaps his jaws wide open to get as much of you as he can in a bite. His head has also twisted sideways to accommodate the stature of his new prey, that being men. \n\nMore notes about the Gaping Dragon: It also excessively vomits, this vomit seeming like more of a security measure to force foes away. This vomit also lowers health, similar to Curse in Dark Souls which worsens your frailness as an undead who is already afflicted with a treacherous immortality that will keep you alive even as you rot. The nature of curse is a bit iffy to me, but that\u2019s outside this discussion; it\u2019s caused by dragon relatives like Seath and the basilisks, possibly because they too are closer to an undead state much like the Ancient Dragons of that universe. \n\nGaping Dragon also appears for Maris and Fulghor. Why? Well, both are weak to lightning too so why not? Fulghor also worshipped lightning gods, possibly dragons given that they had an Elden Lord; the Gaping Dragon is from a different universe, but the association still stands. \n\n////////////////////////////\n\nValiant Gargoyle\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nThe Gargoyles are partly made up of flesh, recycled from champions who\u2019ve perished. The matter on their swords is also made up of dead, but is specifically in the form of a wax. They are used by Leyndell, resurrecting their champions as defenders from beyond the grave; they don\u2019t just protect Leyndell but also the Nameless Eternal City below it. \n\nI think it\u2019s used for Adel\u2019s expedition because of its association with Leyndell and thus lightning. \n\nA fun tidbit: The white waters of the Nameless Eternal City, which run from the Erdtree, may be based on Adipocere, a waxy substance formed from fat when moist. This is likely due to the Erdtree\u2019s roots containing corpses. The presence of Gargoyles gives me the connotation this may be the case; the people of Leyndell also coat their doors and windows in wax. \n\nThe Gargoyle also appears for Maris and Fulghor. The deathly association fits for Maris; coffins appear at the river ends of the nameless city. I could also point out the Leyndell/Lightning connection to go with Fulghor, but there is another. Leyndell is a Holy city and the Valiant Gargoyles are warriors. Fulghor too is a warrior and wields the power of Holy in combat, thus a fitting inclusion upon his expeditions. \n\n///////////\n\nFreyja\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nAn arachnid who hails from Dark Souls 2. It is animated by the soul of Seath, a sorcerous lich dragon who sought immortality out of jealousy of his ancient kin. He coated himself in crystals to achieve a fleeting immortality, crystals being stones affected by the First Flame\u2019s disparity as implied by Twinkling Titanite and the various disparate crystals of DS3 (he also trapped his own soul in a crystal to further his undying nature; he used every precaution). Seath died in DS1, but his soul was recycled into the new age thanks to a Chosen Undead who delivered his soul to the Kiln of the First Flame so that the Age of Fire could continue. \n\nFreyja herself appears to be made of stone and bears stalagmites (or fungus) upon her back. She was kept by the Duke of the town of Tseldora, a mining town for the crystal mineral known as Brightstone (called Pyroxene in Japanese). She outgrew her original size at some point and birthed spiders that could control others via parasitism. \n\nThis theme of parasitism is widespread in Miyazaki\u2019s games, a display of his appreciation of nature and its details. Surprisingly, Freyja isn\u2019t a boss for Gnoster. She is a boss for Adel and Caligo though which makes sense given their nature as dragons. \n\nIt should also be noted that one of Seath\u2019s Channelers oversees the Gaping Dragon, so there is a connection between them via Seath\u2019s interests. \n\nCaligo is visually much alike Seath as she is a crystalline dragon. She also coats herself in ice in order to preserve her life in her Everdark form. \n\nShe also appears for Libra\u2019s Nights. In my mind this is because he\u2019s the closest thing we have to a sorcerer in terms of Night Lords, wielding the golden essence of life to deal damage, like how sorcerers wield residual life energy; in Dark Souls Sorcery deals with soul energy, its strongest form utilizing crystals.

Yes, we see ruins of towns and a few settlements, but nowhere near enough to imply a population capable of supporting empires of the scale we are shown.\n\nI know Leyndell specifically might be empty because of the theory that its population was crammed into the buildings, creating the corpse wax we see everywhere (though I\u2019ve not seen an explanation for why everyone got shoved into their homes lol). But outside Leyndell, where is everyone?\n\nI understand that open world game design affects scale (I know they can\u2019t entirely accurately model an entire continent and its population) and the Tarnished return long after the Shattering. But if the Rune of Death was removed, meaning people basically stopped dying natural deaths, why aren\u2019t there more people around?\n\nBetween deathless populations, giant castles like Stormveil that imply large garrisons or civilian populations, and accounts of major historical wars\u2026 the current emptiness feels strange.

She wielded the power of flame (like her brother messmer) and infused it with the power of destined death to create her weapon she could use to defeat her mother. The Godslaying Black Flame. (This also tracks with how each of the Demigods claimed a great rune from the Elden Ring. The \u201cGreat Rune\u201d of the Gloam Eyed Queen was the Rune of Death) \n\nUltimately Melina met her end as the Gloam Eyed Queen when she was defeated by Maliketh of the Black Blade, Marikas shadow. (This also would give further cause for why the Demigods all feared Maliketh) \n\nHowever, even though Maliketh killed her she did not die, because upon her defeat her mother Queen Marika removed the rune of death from the Elden Ring.

( My own theory is that at this time she remained dormant in the form of a rememberance)\n\nFast forward to the shattering. Marika is now held captive inside the Erdtree by the Greater Will as punishment for shattering the Elden Ring.\n\nMarika knows that only \u201cones who envision Flame\u201d have the power to burn the erdtree and thus gain access to where she is. (As confirmed by Finger Reader Enia)\n\nFrom inside the Erdtree she uses the remembrance of the Gloam Eyed Queen her daughter, to resurrect her as Melina. And tasks her with the role of serving as the Kindling Maiden and aiding the tarnished who would be Lord. \n\n(I think it also might be possible to say she is a special type of spirit ash summon that Marika created from the Gloam Eyed Queen remains)\n\nFast forward to Frenzied Flame ending. Now that the Rune of death has been unsealed by the Tarnished. Her power she wielded as the Gloam Eyed Queen has now also been unsealed as well. \nAnd we see her transformed.\n\nThe reason Melina eye was always closed before was because it held a remnant of the power of destined death. The mark over her eye I believe represented a shard of the Rune of Death. \n\nNow the rune of death is unleashed and the power of Destined death that was sealed in her eye (or perhaps the ability to control Destined Death) has been unleashed with it.\n\nThus the Gloam Eyed Queen is reborn. \n\n\n\n",

Each level of the Divine tower gets smaller and smaller, and the base is noticeably thicker than anything in the base game. I also \"climbed\" the tower and found the area where the lift would normally be in the base game.\n\nThe implication of this is that in the base game, we are only seeing a large portion of the top of the tower.

I know that \"of the heavens\" could set them apart from the concept of \"death's gentle envoys\", but I would like to point out that Maliketh's Black Blade (the weapon and the incantation), and the Black Knife weapons do holy damage, and things related to Black Flame scale on Faith.\n\nAnd the description in the relic received for defeating them reads:\n\n&gt;!A tiny farming village was besieged by bandits, who proceeded to ravage both its plots and people.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!A young village girl, seeking help, dashed into the forest, where she prayed to the statue of a protective deity that held a weapon raised overhead.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!By the end the village was steeped in red and settled in silence.

    "body": "Today I come to you with textual, visual, and symbolic evidence of the primordial form of the Erdtree, the Greattree.\n\n## Textual evidence of the primordial Erdtree aka the Greattree\n\nSeveral item descriptions in game make reference in the English language version to a \"Greattree\" which is implied to be distinct from the golden Erdtree that currently stands. For example, the item descriptions for Deathroot, Map: Deeproot Depths, and Root Resin, respectively, all make distinct references to a \"Greattree\" (Table 1).\n\nThrough these item descriptions we are given enough information to come to several conclusions. First, the vast network of roots we find in-game, particularly within and around catacombs, were originally part of the Greattree before the Erdtree's roots joined with them. Second, the description for Deathroot makes clear that deathroot is spreading _via the Greattree roots, not the Erdtree roots._ Whether this is because the root systems have been disconnected or that the two trees roots still have individual components remains unclear. However, this makes clear that the places we find deathroot, mainly catacombs and graveyards with Tibia Mariners, are directly interacting with the Greattree roots.\n\n| **Table 1.

Later, the Rune of Death spread across the Lands Between through the underground roots of the Greattree, sprouting in the form of Deathroot.         |\n| Map: Deeproot Depths | At the very depths of the Erdtree's majestic roots lies the source of the Ainsel and the Siofra rivers. Here too begins the network of Greattree roots that spread throughout the Lands Between.                                                  |\n| Root Resin           | The roots of the Greattree were once linked to those of the Erdtree, or so they say, and it is for this reason catacombs are built around Greattree roots. Secreted from the roots of the Greattree. Can also be found near trees on the surface. |\n\nAdditionally, there exists several weapons and armor pieces that refer to a \"primordial\" form of the Erdtree. Per Mirriam-Webster's English dictionary, primordial is defined as: (a) \"first created or developed\"; (b) \"existing in or persisting from the beginning (as of a solar system or universe)\"\"; or (c)\"earliest formed in the growth of an individual or organ.\" [1] However, these item descriptions also include distinct references to the \"crucible of life\" when referring to this primordial state. A crucible is defined as (a) \"a vessel of a very refractory (see refractory entry 1 sense 3) material (such as porcelain) used for melting and calcining a substance that requires a high degree of heat;\" (b) \"a severe test;\" or (c) \"a place or situation in which concentrated forces interact to cause or influence change or development.\" [2] Taking these two pieces of information into consideration, one would come to a logical conclusion that there existed a \"crucible of life\" prior to the birth of the Erdtree and that this crucible of life underwent developmental changes that resulted in the golden Erdtree that exists at present.\n\n| **Table 2.

It is said Devonia quested in search of the Crucible's origin, and departed from the lands of the Erdtree alone. |\n\nBased on this textual evidence, the overarching hypothesis for this study is that **_prior to the Erdtree there existed a distinct Greattree that was also deemed the crucible of life_**. This Greattree represents aspect of the crucible, such as horns, red hair, vitality, and is overall distinguished by red-tinted gold. [3-5]\n\n---\n\n## Oak leaf and vine motif denotes pre-Erdtree tree worship\n\nWithin the world of Elden Ring exists several distinct cultures that are delineated by unique architectural and cultural reliefs. One of the earliest known cultures is that of the Sun Realm, which was once a major regional power but has since waned into near extinction. [6] One motif that has arisen as a potential signifier of the Sun Realm is what will be referred to as the \"oak and vine\" motif [(Figure 1A)](https://i.imgur.com/MeEDPxa.jpeg). This specific motif has been documented in numerous influential Sun Realm locations [(Figure 1B-F)](https://i.imgur.com/MeEDPxa.jpeg) and other potential Sun Realm adjacent cultures [(Figure 1G-H)](https://i.imgur.com/MeEDPxa.jpeg). Additionally, this motif has been documented on individual items within several locations, both in the base game and in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC [(Figure 2)](https://i.imgur.com/Kgj20f0.jpeg).\n\nBased on these documentations of the oak and vine motif, we conclude that this motif is representative of a pre-Erdtree society that put great importance on an oak tree. In conjunction with the item descriptions from the previous section, we further hypothesize that the Greattree was most likely an oak tree and was the center of worship for the pre-Erdtree Sun Realm timeperiod.\n\n---\n\n## Living oak trees in The Lands Between\n\nDespite the overwhelming amount of trees in every region of The Lands Between and the Realm of Shadow, there are only three locations, all within The Lands Between, that have living oak trees [(Figure 3)](https://i.imgur.com/5cKn16F.jpeg). Importantly, these three locations are extremely important to the overall lore of the entire Elden Ring universe. First, the Deeproot Depths contains the Nameless Eternal City and the Prince of Death's Throne. The Nameless Eternal City is widely believed to be a Nox settlement that was banished underground after drawing the ire of the Greater Will. The Prince of Death's Throne is where Godwyn the Golden's body was interred following the Night of the Black Knives. It is here that his body spreads Deathroot through the roots of the Greattree (Table 1). Critically, this location also features Crucible Knight Siluria guarding the stump of an oak tree [(Figure 3A-B)](https://i.imgur.com/5cKn16F.jpeg). When taking a broader view of Deeproot Depths we discovered that many roots of the Greattree persist and are growing new branches [(Figure 3C)](https://i.imgur.com/5cKn16F.jpeg). Interestingly, the entrance to the Prince of Death's Throne requires that one passes under the roots of the Greattree [(Figure 3D)](https://i.imgur.com/5cKn16F.jpeg). The symbolic importance of this requirement will be discussed in future articles.\n\nNext, the city of Leyndell contains a single living oak branch. This oak branch is only found growing from the side of the Leyndell Colosseum [(Figure 4A-B)](https://i.imgur.com/e63rYpX.png), a vestige of the crucible era [7]. Specifically, according to the _Ritual Sword Talisman_, the colosseums were built and used to honor the Erdtree via ritual combat [7]. This item description indicates that the switch from Great Oak Tree to Erdtree most likely was a gradual evolution and not a singular moment in time. This conclusion supports the verbiage of other item descriptions describing the crucible as the primordial Erdtree (Table 1, Table 2) and that the definition of primordial indicates the beginning stages of life [1]. Interestingly, this is not the only depiction of oak within Leyndell. In fact, the oak and vine motif is prominent features on the grand door leading to the entrance of the Erdtree [(Figure 4C)](https://i.imgur.com/e63rYpX.png). However, immediately prior to this door is the Elden Throne platform which is adorned instead with the \"grape and vine\" motif [(Figure 4D)](https://i.imgur.com/e63rYpX.png). We suspect that the grape and vine motif specifically represents the culture that co-opted the Greattree and pushed its evoltion into the current day Erdtree. However, the specifics of this theory will be discussed in a future article.\n\nThe final location containing living oak trees is Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree [(Figure 5)](https://i.imgur.com/HVepwJ9.png). Interestingly, this location features the highest concentration of oak trees in the entire game. They are mostly contained to the lower-level graveyards that contain the followers of rot. Elphael is the new home of Miquella\u2019s Haligtree and thus was most likely chosen as it probably housed a Great Oak tree in the past.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n[1] _Definition of PRIMORDIAL_.

The sun realm stuff isn't even related.\n\nThe section about where oak trees exist is almost completely unrelated to your hypothesis.

(Or at least of this generation.)\n\nOne of the most notable traits of the Godslayers is their stark white robes which are made out of the skinned hides of their victims.\n\n\"Robe made by sewing together patches of smooth skin.\"\n~ Godskin Apostle Robe\n\n\"Robe made by sewing together patches of smooth skin.\nSubcutaneous fat makes it plump and soft.\nWorn by Godskin Nobles, known for their seven-face aprons.\"\n~ Godskin Noble Robe\n\n\"Sacred cloth of the Godskin Apostles, made from supple skin sewn together.\"\n~ Godskin Swaddling Cloth\n\nBut whose skin exactly? Who were these Gods and what can we learn about them? \n\nOf all the dialogue concerning Gods in game there is one group who stands out specifically. The Oracle Envoys.\n\n\"Spirits of a monstrous band of musicians who employ sacred arts. It is said that when Oracle Envoys appear, playing their pipes, they do so to herald the arrival of a new god, or age.\"\n~ Oracle Envoy Ashes\n\nThey're specifically mentioned as heralds of new Gods, their ages and presumably their orders. If that is the case that means that they've been around for a LOOOOOOOOONG time, and if so that means that they no doubt would have some at least extant connections to the Godskins.\n\nLo and behold there exists an item which might explain the nature of the Gods in question.\n\n\"Thin strips of flesh taken from a bloodless creature.\"\n~ Strips of White Flesh\n\nThis item specifically is dropped by the Oracle Envoys who themselves seem to have a quite ivory palor. \n\nSo essentially what does that tell us? A couple things actually. The best item of reference to compare it would be its counterpart the Sliver of Meat item.\n\n\"A slice of thinly carved beast flesh.\"\n~ Sliver of Meat\n\nIf we go based off my theory this would establish the Gods in question as:\n\n- White Skinned\n- Bloodless\n- And non-beast\n\nThe last part I assume based not only off of the description but the types of enemies that drop the Strips of White Flesh item.\n\nIf you look at the wiki collectively the common vein amongst most of its carriers are aquatic creatures such as crabs and lobsters. To me this indicates that these Gods may have had origins that lay in the water.\n\nAnother vein of thought that supports this is the mention of an alternative evolutionary process mentioned in the Godskin gear:\n\n\"Nobles are the most ancient apostles\nwho are said to have assimilated inhuman physiology.\"\n~ Godskin Noble Robe\n\nThe assimilation of inhuman physiology is what grabs me here. It might even imply that the Gods they hunted evolved based off an alternative to the Crucible, and the Crucibles creation may have been a more recent occurrence. This is also supported considering that the Godskins were known for borrowing other things from the Gods they hunted as well:\n\n\"Once a sign of the gods' wrath, this incantation became a trophy of the Nobles' god hunt.\"\n~ Noble Presence\n\nIt's quite possible that the Godskins white skin itself came about as a result of their hunt.\n\nI'd love to know everyone's thoughts! Happy Lore Hunting!!!",

I never noticed this, but they have a bottom jaw bone with teeth wrapped around their head. It is almost certainly bone, and distinctly different to the rest of their body, which kind of confirms that they are connected to the giant skulls found around the Lands Between.\n\nI've finished both of the new bosses and all the remembrance quests as well, and there are plenty of \"possible\" secrets.

These enemies paired together is interesting, though not surprising to me given what I believe about that whole chunk of the lore.\n* I'm still piecing things together, but I think the Cleansing Tear might end up being the \"birthing droplet\" that Letenna gives to the large Albinauric women at the end of her quest. The Scholar says something along the lines of \"find out manifest desire and reclaim our fair\". I think he believes that it can cure their advanced aging at first, but his quest end by saying \"it has not the power to change our fate. It is however, an artifact of great import - let it be know to history\".\n* The Dreglord has the skull of Manus, has a very similar build and weapons to Manus, and fights like Gael. To me, he is what's left over from the Dark Souls universe, a culmination of corpses after the world converged in on itself at the end of Dark Souls 3, which is why he shares the form and weapon of Manus and fights like Gael, not to mention the reuse of the word \"Dreg\" (The Dreg Heap). Never forget the tweet from the Dark Souls Twitter account prior to the games release: *\"In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright.\"*\n* Edit: Just remembered as well, and I could be completely wrong about this because I'm still putting it all together, but the Undertaker \"might\" be the grown up child of the Recluse.\n\nThat's all I can remember right now, but there is heaps of little things.",

    "body": "This post is a follow-up to a negatively received post I released to this sub back in September. The central claim of that post was that a copy of Malenia's soul and her memories were stored within her sword, The Hand of Malenia. Recently, the Nightreign DLC has been released and lends even more evidence to this claim in the Balancers of Harmonia boss fight. While this post will talk about how Nightreign builds off of this theory, the vast, vast majority of my evidence will still be found in the canon main Elden Ring game.\n\nSpoilers For the Nightreign DLC Ahead\n\nLet us begin with a quick summary of Malenia\u2019s story. Malenia was born an Empyrean of a single God, curse-laden, along with her brother, Miquella. It is thus that Malenia was afflicted with the rotting sickness, harboring its Outer God within, from the day she was born. Miquella, grieving for his sister\u2019s health, abandoned Golden Order Fundamentalism for the radiance of Unalloyed Gold.\n\n\n\nBut how exactly does Unalloyed Gold assist Malenia? Sage Gowry tells us that \u201cThe rotting sickness erodes one's memory.\u201d Furthermore, the Poison Mist incantation tells us that rot is the cycle of rebirth put into practice. The Juvenile Scholar set tells us that rebirth is \u201cas to sleep, and with each awakening memory fades into oblivion.\u201d\n\n  \nWe find Malenia beside the roots of Haligtree, embraced in richest slumber. As we approach, the camera fixes its gaze upon the Hand of Malenia, and a gust of wind awakens the winged valkyrie. By all previous notions of rebirth and rot learned through Millicent and the rest of the game, Malenia should be little more than a puddle of flesh, melting into the Haligtree. And yet gusts of wind summon the will to awaken, feelings which the Lulling Branch says arise from the depths of one\u2019s heart - the soul.\n\n\n\nSpinning slash, \u201ca skill of dexterous warriors,\u201d can be tied to the Blue Dancer through its being found on the Schimitar, the starting weapon of the Warrior class, who dons the Dancer\u2019s armor. The skills slash foes as the body spins, the memories of the weapon summoning gusts of wind at the wielder's feet. Knight Bernhal teaches us, after all, that Ashes of War are memories of battles past.\n\n\n\nThe Cleanrot Spears wielded by Malenia\u2019s knights are \u201cblessed with an incantation that wards off rot.\u201d According to Jerren, this is an unusual property that only the weapons forged at the Haligtree and those forged by Master Iji share. The Cleanrot Spear also has the ability to \u201crelease the power of a hidden incantation, to erect a palisade of golden spears frontwards.\u201d This sacred phalanx is quite similar to that summoned by Messmer\u2019s assault. The Spear of the Impaler is \u201cremade (cloned) by the forging arts of the shadow realm,\u201d also known as the practice of smithscript. Smithing in the shadow realm was the art of interpreting the script \u201cperceived in the wrinkles of molten steel to imbue weapons with souls.\u201d The Hand of Malenia possesses runes on it that may be the result of such perception. The mark of a bold, meticulous craftsman, who, according to Gowry, \u201cgrasps the essence of life itself.\u201d That essence, of course, being runes, which script is derived from, or another word for. Miquella is also a master of manipulating memory. His charm makes Ansbach and the other followers forget events that may make them prone to violence.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fog that vexed my aging faculties has been lifted. And follies better left forgotten haunt me once again.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother point to consider is what Miquella leaves behind for the Tarnished when we defeat him at the foot of the Gate of Divinity: his memory.\n\n\n\nSo, the Miquella, master craftsman of memory and souls, created a needle to ward off an Outer God. What else wards off the influence of the Outer Gods? The Nox Mirror Helm, found in the Cliffbottom Catacombs, along with Kaiden Sellsword Ashes, behind an illusory wall. These Sellswords originate from the north and can be found prowling the Consecrated Snowfields, the lands of the Haligtree. And what does a mirror do? It creates a copy of a person. It is curious that Iji, a wearer of a mirror helm, is one of the only people in the Lands Between who can forge weapons that resist rot.\n\n\n\nThe diminutive shield on the Cleanrot Spear, which is blessed with the incantation that allows the weapon to produce spectral copies of itself and protect itself against the rot, shares a striking resemblance to the Moon of Nokstella - except for one key difference. If you look closely at the center of the shield, there is a ring of script around the center. What does the Moon of Nokstella increase for the player? Memory. This moon imagery is shared by the Halo Scythe, weapons wielded by the Commanders within Malenia\u2019s army. Now, this is never actually shown, but there is a Golden Crescent Moon which YouTuber Scum Mage Infa discovered with freecam in Ranni\u2019s Ending, which, keeping all the previous bits in mind, means that Miquella likely practices a form of moon magic. Renalla bewitched the Academy wither her moon, and Miquella is a craftsman of \u201cBewitching Branches\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn summary, Miquella\u2019s incantation with Unalloyed Gold comes from runes/script (which he likely learned from his father, Radagon) and makes copies. It is this ability to make a copy over and over again from engraved memory that allows the weapon to restore itself and resist the scarlet rot. Malenia also creates spectral copies of herself in phase two.\n\n\n\nMy claim is that after Malenia removed the needle, a partial copy of Malenia\u2019s soul was within the Hand of Malenia. This copy is not only a result of the script engraved into the weapon, but also of its extensive use by Malenia. Ashes of War are memories of battle that bleed into the weapon. The Lost Ashes of War tells us how the copy passes into the genuine article. A gust of wind from the Hand of Malenia awakens Malenia and restores her memories. Malenia herself is rotten to the core, but the sword cannot rot - the sword remembers.\n\n\n\nWhen I posted this last time (admittedly with less evidence), people were unconvinced and downvoted my post into oblivion. Now, with the release of the Weapon Bequeathed Harmonia (whom I will refer to as Harmonia from now on) boss fight, we may conclusively put this matter to rest.\n\n*\"Some claim to have seen wings when the weapon was raised aloft;\u00a0wings of fierce determination that have never known defeat.\"*\n\nHarmonia was a girl who, to protect her village, prayed to a statue of Malenia, and in was bequeathed to her spear. This spear gives her the power of the memory of Malenia. Given that the spear turned her gaze vacant, the girl who prayed may not be the one in control here. And that is precisely what we see in phase 2.   \n  \nBut before we discuss that, let's talk about some of Harmonia\u2019s moves. She clones not only her weapons but herself. This proves the connection between the incantation of Sacred Phalanx and Malenia\u2019s rot clone attack. Before and with Harmonia\u2019s context, they are very clearly the same magic. In the transition to phase 2, the spear is raised aloft, and Harmonia gains pink-scarlet wings, just like Malenia. But it is not Harmonia who raises the spear, but the spear that raises Harmonia. It drags her into the air, and suddenly she is \u201cherself\u201d again.\n\n\n\nMalenia\u2019s soul, which was in the keeping of her flesh, has fully rotten away by the time we find her, as expected, and seen in characters like Radahn (I theorize it is his weapons and ashes of war that keep him holding the stars; it is all he remembers). But Malenia\u2019s sword summons a gust of wind and restores her memory. The soul is in the sword. Or more accurately, a copy of her soul that has passed into being the genuine article.\n\n  \nThe thematic implications of this will be discussed in my next post.",

    "body": "The SotET DLC ends with Miquella's flashback to a promise with Radahn. Many question this, but FromSoft make it very clear that this is a full circle moment with Radahn's armor.  Elden Ring was revealed to the world with a story trailer ending with a fight between Radahn and Malenia, where Malenia whispers something we cannot hear to Radahn, right after breaking her needle and beginning to bloom with rot.\n\nThere has been much speculation about what the vow may have been. Many have thought that the whole thing is contrived BS.  I don't think that FromSoft would highlight a moment like this unless they really liked the story beat though.\n\nOthers have suggested that the vow was that Radahn must be killed in order to be resurrected, but he demanded (or the plan required) that he die in battle.  An issue with this is - why then would they bring armies to a duel and waste so many lives?  This doesn't seem to be in character with Radahn or Miquella/Malenia (as we have reason to doubt that Malenia was bloodthirsty, having spared Godrick when he was at her mercy, for example.)\n\nOther suggest that perhaps Radahn had made the vow, but changed his mind. Or that Miquella made a one sided vow to make Radahn serve him. Or that Radahn made the \"vow\" in jest but Miquella took it super seriously and led a war to make sure it was fulfilled. These theories suggest that when Radahn is brought back, it is only Miquella's evil charms that control him. \n\nI would propose an explanation that fits squarely in the camp of all parties involved having relatively noble intentions, yet the end result was a terrible tragedy - something thematically on point for FromSoft.\n\n\n---\nThe Shattering War has been raging.  Demigods have fought and fell.  It will not end until order can be restored.  Miquella wants as peaceful a resolution as possible, but the fact is that force is needed.  Miquella and Malenia approach Radahn with a truce and an offer - we end this war together, and Radahn will become the Lord, while Miquella becomes the new god.  To do this, they must unite the remains of the Lands Between.\n\nHowever, Radahn added a simple stipulation to this.  The one thing that would truly irk him about allying with Miquella and Malenia is is that Radahn knew of Malenia's reputation.  Of the demigods, everyone knew that Malenia and Radahn were thought to be most powerful - but who was truly the greatest? If they allied, Radahn would never learn who between them was the strongest. \n\nRadahn would join forces and they would pacify the rest of the squabbling throughout the Lands Between, but only if at the conclusion Malenia would duel him.  Miquella and Malenia agreed to this - pacify the Lands Between so that a person could walk from one end to the other, unmolested.  From Oridina to Redmane Castle.  Then Malenia would fight Radahn.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this battle between Malenia and Radahn is indicated to be the last major battle of the Shattering War. Fast forward and their combined forces manage to put down the various unnamed demigods lost to time.  On the way, Malenia defeats Godrick, but leaves him alive.  By the time that Malenia meets with Radahn in CAelid, any other resisting factions have been put down.\n\nNow, two allied armies are gathered in Caelid. There is celebration - finally the wars are over after who knows how long.  But there is a final event before everyone goes home.  The highlight of the celebration is that Radahn and Malenia shall fight to see who is strongest.  Afterward, Radahn will become Miquella's Lord.  They'll have three great runes between them, and can go to Leyndell.\n\nRadahn and Malenia battle, as shown in the Story Trailer for Elden Ring.  It's fierce, but Malenia IS prideful. We know that Millicent says she represents Malenia's pride lost by giving in to the scarlet rot.  It appears Malenia will lose.  Malenia breaks her needle in desperation and releases the rot.  She is rather cocky about it.  She says the vow is fulfilled.\n\nNote that we never see the true conclusion of the fight in the story trailer.  Just an enormous flower blooming from Radahn's back.  By the end of the battles in Caelid, we are told that Malenia was rendered unconscious and must be carried back by Finley.  Radahn will have gone mad and now eats the bodies of friend and foe alike.  Malenia considers herself to still be undefeated, or at least lies to herself about it.  Radahn is still called the strongest demigod by many though.\n\nIt seems that whatever the true outcome, there was likely some debate or confusion about who the victor was.  But what is clear is that neither combatant seems to have clearly won.\n\nNow imagine this from the perspective of the two armies, watching from the sidelines. Two armies, allied under their respective generals/lords. Gathered in celebration, yes.  But it is tentative - everyone else has been defeated. This war has gone on seemingly endlessly - is it truly over?  Can we believe it's over? Will we have peace?\n\nAfter the battle, Malenia's rot is blooming from her.  She must be carried away.  Radahn is now losing his mind. Neither side has a general able to function.\n\nOn Malenia's side, talk among the troops is that Radahn challenged Malenia as a way to try and kill her.  Kill the general, then conquer the army.  He must have done something underhanded!\n\nFrom Radahn's side, did you see what foul sorcery Malenia unleashed? Spectators of the battle are getting sick! It is with that unclean plague that she was rumored to harbor.\n\nOn both sides, the troops are battle hardened. They are used to war. They have lived war for years unending. When they think of peace, they can hardly imagine it.  And now their generals have each been incapacitated.  There is no one to to cool the situation. Tensions run hot and the armies revert to what they know best - war.\n\n\nBattle breaks out and it spreads. It consumes all of Caelid. \n\nPerhaps Radahn and Malenia are still present. Still capable of action. Perhaps they are already fully incapacitated.  It doesn't matter though, as the blaze has started.\n\nPersonally, I think that the two demigods were likely simply weakened at first.  But as the battle broke out, Malenia came to fight once again.  With the needle broken, she bloomed once again.  This led to the massive Aeonian Swamp bloom - and is why an item description speaks of the third bloom being when Malenia arose as Goddess of Rot.  This likely left her weak and comatose. It may have been at this point that she realized the folly of what her pride had wrought, and when Millicent and her sisters budded from her.\n\nBut I don't think the details here are able to be fully known.  In broad strokes, Malenia/Miquella's army allied with Radahn's.  They fought an honorable duel at the end of the Shattering War.  The duel went sidewise, leaving no clear victor and neither individual capable of acting as a leader.  In the fog of war and the uncertainty, the armies reverted to what they knew and began to fight.  Weakened or incapacitated, the leaders could not control their armies.  The end result was a bloody battle that was unnecessary and unintended.",

In Marika's spoken echo, she's telling godfrey and his men to do certain things before brandishing the elden ring. This implies they don't have access to the elden ring yet. If marika already had the ring, they could brandish it then and there. Defeating the giants and gaining access to the forge could have enabled godfrey to use the same warp gate to farum azula that the player uses in-game. I think when godfrey defeated placidusax he brought the elden ring back to marika and she ate it.",

    "body": "So, I'm building a grand theory, still tentative but becoming clearer. When I look at all the major forces shaping the Lands Between (the Greater Will, the Three Fingers, Marika, Ranni, Miquella, and even the Elden Ring itself), something never adds up when I try to place any of them at the true center. And yes, I\u2019m aware that Marika and Radagon share the same body. But my point is that neither Marika nor the Greater Will (nor any of the known Outer Gods) feels like the actual structural pivot of the mythos. The only figure who does, at least from the perspective of the connections I\u2019m seeing, is Radagon. He seems to be the defining figure of the One Great, but only through mirroring it. And conceptually, it could be argued that it all starts with the introduction of Demon\u2019s Souls. Is it simply a coincidence that you hear the same melody when facing Radagon in his god form? Because that\u2019s also where it all culminates.\n\nHe stands at the crossroads of every major narrative thread, metaphysical contradiction, and divine influence. And the usual explanation that he was simply a former servant or champion of the Golden Order does not cut it. It feels far too shallow for someone positioned at the heart of so many cosmic strands. In that sense, from a metaphysical standpoint, he seems like the true nexus of the entire cosmology, not just as a god but as a structural idea as well.\n\nI\u2019m working on formalizing this theory but I\u2019m still missing some insights. The main gap is that we know almost nothing about Radagon's true origins. I get the sense that if even a small piece of that background were revealed, all the connections I'm seeing would snap into place. Meanwhile we actually have more information about almost every other major figure, including the Outer Gods and how they define or oppose one another on an ontological level.\n\nAnd there is also another layer I'm trying to understand. I suspect there is a very deeply hidden connection, something that might be truly foundational for both Leyndell and Farum Azula, between Radagon, Placidusax, Gransax, and Bayle. If that link could be clarified in terms of timelines or the placement of certain events, I believe it would define the entire structure of the mythos. But right now, that part is still blurry for me. So I'd appreciate any theories on that front.\n\nAt the moment, my view is that the real key is to understand Radagon fully. If his origin, his nature, and the true depth of his purpose (rather than just the appearance of it) were made clear, the whole Elden Ring cosmology would likely resolve into something much more coherent.\n\nAs a side note, I\u2019m also trying to get some perspectives on how Messmer's placement in the Land of Shadow ties back to Radagon, whether narratively, symbolically, or metaphysically. If anyone has thoughts on that connection, it would help me form a clearer picture. Any input would be appreciated.",

Both are then only spiritual beings - encompassing mind, intellect, faith and the arcane, unshackled by natural/bodily/earthly  physiology - who can then \"ascend\" into a higher realm by absorbing divine energies. \n\nMarika also underwent a process of purification (which may have also killed her...) through the jar rituals of the Hornsent, where she was separated into a cleansed heavenly/spiritual half (Marika) and an impure earthly/bodily half (Radagon). Their natures and the domain of their powers (mental/spiritual vs physical) are reflected by their colours and Soreseals. Since Marika's soul is the actual vessel of the divine energies, and she had control over the four spiritual \"stats\", she could control and shape the divinity inside her into the form of the Elden Ring, reshape its form and properties, as well as later destroy it. \n\nThis obviously left Radagon in a bunch of existential torment, since he was \"born\" as an inherently impure chimera composed of every part of her body and soul Marika discarded to become a god - forever separated from her, yet also bound to her for eternity. He hates himself, he hates his own \"nature\" (both his origins and what he's actually composed of - the \"natural\" parts), and his whole schtick is about becoming as far removed from himself as possible. \n\nThis is why he learns incantations (faith), later moves to Liurnia to master sorceries (intelligence), tries to combine the two in a unified philosophical system, and is completely obsessed with all manners of order, symmetry, purity, balance, divinity, etc. Because they're antithethical to his chaotic earthly nature. He is born as an impure physical \"tool\" of Marika's heavenly \"mind\", and so tries with all his might to become (more like) her - and replace her. \n\nBut his self-hatred is also his eventual downfall: because he hates all natural and chaotic things, he despises and never learns the arcane, which is crucial for control over the Elden Ring. This is why he can't repair it in the end, and poetically ends up as what he fought so hard against his whole life - a mindless weapon,  a physical tool controlled by the intent of higher powers.",

Since the Realm of Shadows is where all manner of death wash up, this destruction would bring him to the realm where the Gate of Divinity is housed.\n\nAnother possible interpretation, similar to the last one, is that he used Mohg's blood rituals, not to destroy his body, but to cause enough deaths that Miquella could use that to open a pathway to the Realm of Shadows. If you look around Mohgwyn Palace and the immediate surrounding area, there are piles upon piles of corpses, mostly comprised of Albinaurics. We also later see that the Gate of Divinity is comprised of countless corpses (which, in the DLC trailer, were once fresh before later petrifying over time like what we see in-game). It is possible that Miquella charmed Mohg and directed him to perform his blood rituals by sacrificing Albinaurics and other beings. Since we know a certain amount of ritual is involved in the ascension to godhood, given the Sacred Rite Scroll, it is possible that the Sacred Rite requires mass death in order for an empyrean to ascend (hence the bloody Gate of Divinity in the trailer). This might explain why Albinaurics sought the Haligtree, but none are found in the area proper\u2014they may have been deceived at a grave cost to them.",

They can be skipped. They are there to connect ideas between games and display common themes. \n\n//////////////////////////////////////\n\nSnake-Snails (Snailkes)\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nWhy do they exist? I think what\u2019s squarely to blame is the Crucible. The Crucible is responsible for animal-like traits being transferred onto humans via mutation, but it\u2019s also tied to creatures such as the Hippopotami, chimeric beasts found in the Realm of Shadow (and who fight alongside Crucible Knights in Nightreign), meaning it also meshes and melds the features of various animals onto other animals. \n\nThere are five Snake-Snail variants (one unused). The standard Snake-Snails appear in Volcano Manor, appropriately, as well as in other disparate location such as Nokstella and Rauh. They drop Serpent Arrows, attributed to a group known as the Formless Serpents. They slither, bite, and spit poison. Not much to note, but the Rauh location feels like it points towards my Crucible Hypothesis rather cleanly. \n\nThe Volcano Manor hosts the God-Devouring Serpent so there\u2019s a correlation with their appearance there. \n\nIt should be noted that you can connect Snakes with the element of fire in this game via their symbology, finding their way amongst the Godskins, Rykard, and Messmer; one of Messmer\u2019s symbols is a caduceus (a classical symbol involving two snakes), a sort of spiral, thus perhaps associating the snake with the Crucible and its spiral symbol; a connection possible to make due to minor details like how flame spirals in various magical forms, such as Furnace Golems which have Fire Giant Masks, giants being blessed by the Crucible according to the Talisman-of-all-Crucibles, and Embers of Messmer\u2019s being used to craft Fire Spritestones out of Rauh Burrows. The physiology of Godskin Nobles are also compared to the melding of the Crucible via their robes, and they bear reptilian tails. \n\nSnakes are also associated with poison, obviously; it should also be noted that Marais Manor, east and downstream of Gelmir, apparently once hosted the wielders of the Serpent Arrows (according to early versions - 1.00 apparently; my only source is a spreadsheet put together by Garden of Eyes); the House and its members are sick and associated with poison. \n\nNokstella is a harder locale to connect, especially since I know most people haven\u2019t even noticed the Snake-Snails there. They are found in a small section of the lower city, to the right of the river going downstream from the Nokstella Grace. There are no real connections here, besides tangential connections of a distant nature which don\u2019t explain much of anything. \n\n1. Ranni was involved with the Eternal Cities, getting its assassins to her side. Her brother is connected to her conspiracy to assassinate Godwyn, but that doesn\u2019t really explain the Snake-Snails\u2019 appearance here. \n2. (Warning: Unhinged Archaeology [\ud83e\udd2e] Speculation) The Eternal Cities have no connection to the Crucible, but the Night may. Dewgems are lotus flowers found in the Realm of Shadow which are fed on Night-tinged dew. They are found by water here, notably appearing in Rauh. Another night related thing in this realm are Larval Tears which are conjured at Spirit Graves at Night. They are functionally the same as the Silver Larvae in the base game. There isn\u2019t much here; they aren\u2019t really anything besides natural vermin (I was going to go off on a tangent about the giant stone coffins which are depicted on stelae in the Ancient Dynastical territories; some SOTE concept art depicts one atop Rauh; basically I was going to say that the Rauh people became the Ancient Dynasties and Nox, but that\u2019s too conspiratorial for talking about why snake-snails are in Nokstella; especially since it doesn\u2019t even explain anything besides why they\u2019re in both locations). \n3. The Silver Tears of the Nox are based on Alchemical beliefs regarding quicksilver, a fluctuating semi-fluid substance. An important symbol of Alchemy is the snake (in other esoteric systems it can take the form of the Ouroburos), sometimes depicted as a three headed dragon representing salt (body), quicksilver (mind), and sulfur (soul). The caduceus is a related symbol consisting of snakes forming a spiral. A word that can be used to conceptually tie these things together is the word \u201cformless\u201d; it\u2019s used to describe multiple things relating to the Arcane stat, such as the Formless Mother, the \u201cFormless\u201d Dragon Communion Seal (according to the seal\u2019s description), and the Formless Serpents and \u201cFormless\u201d Silver Tears (according to the Silver Tear Mask description). \n\nThe Cobra-Snails got cut from the game so there\u2019s nothing to talk about regarding them. \n\nInstead we could talk about the arrows and their accompanying bow. I mentioned earlier that an early version of the game stated that the Formless Serpents were once minions of Marais; the bow is found in the Abandoned Cave, full of trashed Abductor Virgins. It would stand to reason these Formless Serpents were possibly minions of Rykard, the cave dump being a Volcano Manor storage site in Caelid due to an alliance between the Carian brothers\u2019. Radahn may\u2019ve had use for them, who knows. The bow is powered by pagan magic; Arcane; the God-Devouring Serpent potentially being considered a pagan God (alluded to by the Serpent-God\u2019s Curved Sword). The arrows have a caduceus in place of fletching. \n\nMakes me wonder\u2026 perhaps the Formless Serpents used Invisibility Sorcery to get their moniker, potentially because the dump is near Sellia and some Serpent-Snails are found in Nokstella?\n\nI bring that up because the Serpent-Snails drop the arrows for some reason. That always felt weird to me. They don\u2019t have pockets. Do we make them from them? Is this the only way (other than corpses) the devs could think of to get us these arrows? It feels like a Dark Souls 2 situation to me where we needed a certain animal enemy to drop a certain human item (I\u2019m specifically referencing the kobolds that drop Black Knight weapons). \n\nOther than them there is the crystal Snake-Snail, one you might encounter earlier as they appear in the Lakeside Crystal Cave. They appear in multiple locations where crystals are present, such as the Altus Tunnel, the broader Liurnian area, the Consecrated Snowfield (ice is crystal and treated as a type of Glintstone, appearing as buds here like the Crystal Bud), Sellia Crystal Tunnel, and the Moonlight Altar. \n\nGlintstone parasitizes life, as demonstrated by the Glintstone Fireflies they can drop. They can still spit poison and have additional powers such as spitting Glintstone as projectiles or trails. The areas they inhabit have the same overarching crystalline visuals so their crystalline properties are explainable, but why snake-snails in these locations? Besides crystal, (some of) these locations have Carian associations (which could involve Rykard) such as the Altus and Sellia Tunnels which have Crystallians at their ends. The Moonlight Altar is Carian property and those in base Liurnia are around the crystalline zones below the altar. The Snowfield holds the Rotten Duelists who are decorated with snakes; the snakes come \u201calive\u201d during grab attacks\u2026 but the Duelists have no apparent lore other than serving in ritual combat during Godfrey\u2019s reign, the snake being a despised symbol. Why are they rotten? Did they fight alongside Radahn/Malenia? Is it rotten blood? Did they enter Malenia\u2019s rotten gash? Besides them, Ordina is nearby, has Black Knife Assassins in its gaol, and Loretta serves the Haligtree, so\u2026 \n\nHonestly, there\u2019s no straightforward reason these little guys are so widespread, and aren\u2019t so widespread. Symbolic associations are nearby, but not every Crystallian cave is accompanied by Snake-Snails. Their presence is arbitrary. \n\nSkeletal Snake-Snails are\u2026 still snaily. They still fold into their shells and their skeleton\u2019s length is the same as the others. Their\u201dshells\u201d are large humanoid skulls. They are found in the Death Bird section of the graveyard within Leyndell\u2019s outer layer of walls, the Sage\u2019s Grotto (With Garris; Black Knife Assassin nearby), and the mass graveyard atop the Mountaintops (with the Mariner). \n\nThey are among Those Who Live in Death. They can breathe out Ghostflame Wraiths and nothing else. They can roll like the others, touching mouth to tail, which is interesting. It may not be intentional but this would replicate the shape of an Ouroboros. The Ouroburos is a symbol of a snake eating its own tail, symbolizing the cycle of life and death; rebirth. Since they live within death I would say this is fitting. \n\nThe graveyards they appear in are supposedly for the Golden Order as one is found in Leyndell\u2019s walls and the other is in the Mountaintops where the Golden Order fought the Giants. The latter does contain giant spirits, possibly traitors of the Fire Giants, like the trolls; if not it may be a grave for those before (astrologers and giants). Both have a local Deathbird so it\u2019s possible that both yards predate Order. Snakes would fit then, but why didn\u2019t the Order excise these elements? \n\nGarris\u2019s cave is an undead sanctuary, the snakes acting as Garris\u2019s familiars (the sheltering of the assassin here also makes sense). The cave is downstream of Mount Gelmir. \n\nSnakes are related to spirituality as seen by Rykard and Eingley, their body containing many spirits, even summoning them via the mouth and the dispersed heat from unsettling the corpses that make up the cavern floor (if you hadn\u2019t noticed, the mist that summons the fire wraiths during his fight is amassed from his swings hitting the ground). \n\nThe last Snake-Snail is the Spiritcaller Snail. They lack snail eyes and they shake their heads and tails to emit a ringing like a Spiritcaller Bell to summon forth spirits. One is in the Road\u2019s End Catacombs summoning a Crucible Knight to its defense. One lingers in the top floor of the Leyndell Catacombs where it summons Leyndell soldiers to its defense. A few are posted up in the Haligtree Village to summon Crystallians. A bunch of them linger in the Spiritcaller\u2019s Cave, summoning wolves, disciples of Okina, and Godskins. \n\nIt would seem to me that these guys are actually deployed, not just nesting. They may have an affinity with spirits but they defend positions strategically such as, what would\u2019ve been, the entrance to the Leyndell Catacombs, the Road\u2019s End\u2019s roots, and the Haligtree Village Roofs. It could just be coincidence. The Cave seems like their natural habitat as it flows with a magic river which supports the nearby flora (magic is residual life energy as explained by Sellen\u2019s explanation of Glintstone, as well as the forces behind Ghostflame and the powers of Ancestral Spirits and their followers). \n\nThe Cave is very interesting. We see wolves settle other caves so it seems they all perished but are kept alive by the snails who use them for defense. The disciples, the Inaba, chased Okina after he abandoned them. They sought death through combat, having found it and becoming fodder for the snails. The Godskins are the most thought-provoking inclusion. Their ghosts here would seem to imply some Godskin presence in the Mountaintops some time ago. There is a heavy fiery presence on the Mountaintops; besides the Fire Giants; it\u2019s possible Messmer served here due to the impalement of the giants and the presence of the Giant/Fell mask(s) on the Furnace Golems. Melina lights the Forge and is possibly the Gloam-Eyed Queen. I\u2019m not sure if the cult had a start on the Mountaintops but it might make sense given the fight with the Godskins and the war with the Giants happened early in Marika\u2019s reign. \n\nDon\u2019t remember if I mentioned it, but the Godskins are associated with snakes via one on Gelmir. I suppose the Snakes of this cave can further this connotation; this snaky connotation is further bolstered by the fact both the Godskins and Rykard wish to usurp. \n\nAn early fringe theory I remember is that the Godskins are Eternal City adjacent. Why? A few things. They morph like how quicksilver is described, though there is no shared visual language; there\u2019s also no shared visual language with the Crucible either. If they are kin to Melina it could at least explain some connection since they would be kin to Marika. The main connection is their use of black flame like how the Assassins use the Rune of Death, but the assassins are later, after the failed rebellion; they have a common cause at least. The Godskins are supporting rebelling forces, siding with Rykard (one also defends the death-stricken corpse of Ranni, the main plotter who used the assassins). \n\nSnake-Snails (Snailkes) inherit the broader symbolism of snakes, that being spirituality. The crystal ones contain Glintstone, the skeletal ones breathe wraiths, and the Spiritcallers summon spirits; Eingley contains and amasses spirits, etc\u2026\n\nI forgot to mention earlier, but the Abyssal Serpent of Messmer is also spiritual to some extent. The Furnace Pot says the flames of the Furnace Golems burn away both body and soul. The furnaces feasibly contain a combo of Fell and Abyssal Flame, but given the connotation of the Abyss and Serpents (harkening back to Dark Souls) it would seem the Abyssal Flame is what does the consumption. Flame is very spiritual; the Frenzied Flame similarly destroys souls, the Fell Flame is conducted by the Fell God who lives on through his subjects, Ghostflame destroys bodies and raises spirits, Destined Death\u2019s flames ensure death for body and soul, and the Black Flame is more ambiguous, being the tool of death for the Godskins, but potentially a weaker/ened version of Destined Death. \n\nThis theme of serpentine spirituality goes back to earlier games.\n\n////////\n\nSlugs\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nThe basic slug appears to be wrapped in a blanket of filth, appearing in filthy places themselves. They amass in the pools of the Shaded Castle, the moat around the Capital, the misty woods of the Altus (where they spit Deathblight), the sewers where they squelch in slop and manure, and even in Castle Sol. They typically spit slime to slow you (like a velvet worm) and drop white flesh. They are associated with filth, and perhaps death due to Sol and the woods. \n\nThere are also fire slugs. They appear on Mount Gelmir, but aren\u2019t exclusive to there. They appear near smoldering butterflies which flutter around in some very random areas; they also drop them. A batch can be found near the road to the Limgrave colosseum; to the right of the road leading there, just before the overhead bridge. Another batch is found on the lower plateau southeast of the Church of Vows; Fire Monks camp out here. Another bunch are on the right of the large walkway leading from the Outer Wall Phantom Tree Grace; before the Leyndell main gate walkway. Another bunch are northeast of the Guardian\u2019s Garrison. A bunch more are also found on the right side of the frozen river leading to Theodorix. Who knows if these are a species of their own or just slugs that have adapted to fire? I tried to figure this out via their neighboring butterflies. Smoldering Butterflies are found near fires, but are they the cause of them or merely follow them? I\u2019d say in some cases they follow such as seen with campfires; you\u2019d have to kill them in order to use them to start fires, so I don\u2019t think they intentionally start fires themselves. It\u2019s entirely pointless but are Burning Slugs another species, do fires transform slugs into them; are the butterflies responsible for wildfires; and why are these slugs sometimes found in such random locations? My hypothesizes are: Burning Slugs are a species and cause fires, attracting butterflies; butterflies cause fires and slugs burn in them; both are just attracted to fires (but were they burning before or no?).\n\n///////////\n\nSlimes\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nSlimes are messes of filth and dead flesh. They\u2019re made from necrotic flesh and can contain maggots, feathers, hair, and bones. They have many variants, including poison, rot, blood, lightning, and putrescence. They seem to be creatures that have melted and amassed, yet still live due to the Rune of Death being taken away, such undying devastation being possible because of the Shattering war which has caused \u201cdead\u201d masses to congeal and transform. \n\nWithout access to the roots, and with traditional death being gone, these things amass in squalid conditions where the dead go unburied (Rot brings forward new life). They\u2019re their own living things now. \n\nThe basic kind are found in the squalid muck outside the Murkwater Catacombs, on the ramparts of the Lower Morne Castle, in corners of Redmane Castle, Wyndham Catacombs, and the Consecrated Snowfield. \n\nThe poisonous green kind are found in the pools of the Tombsward Cave and Seethewater Cave. \n\nThe rotten kind can be found in certain areas in Caelid, but prominently in the Minor Erdtree Catacombs. They seem to contain bug shells like those of the Kindred of Rot. \n\nThe bloody kind seem fresh as they are soaked red and covered in blisters. They are found in the Writhblood Ruins, Moghwyn Palace, and Blood Ruins in Nightreign. They may be made of the Dynasty\u2019s victims, perhaps they are ritually soaked to be kept bloody for the mother. \n\nThe lightning kind are found on the Jagged Peak, surging with red lightning. They\u2019re probably made of melted dragon, particularly the Drakes who inherited Bayle\u2019s Lightning. Either that or they\u2019re made of the men who made the climb. Perhaps a mix of both. \n\nThe Putrescence is the remains of ancient beings once contained in the colossal coffins of the Cerulean Coast and Fissure. The flesh is sloppy, wet, and mucky; it doesn\u2019t appear like rotten flesh, instead more like frozen cafeteria slop. I suppose these would form in cold conditions like the fissure; they\u2019ve had time to melt and accumulate. They were burnt by cold Ghostflame in the past (according to the Putrescence Spells), perhaps helping make their melted appearance and color; the conditions are also similar to the Gaols which are lit with Ghostflame and have their own brand of wet amassed flesh (It\u2019s possible the Hornsent were inspired by the practice of the coffins). This flesh is close to the spiritual as well as it can be used to make Piquebone Arrows which conjure shadows where they land, shadows which appear similar to those produced by the Alluring Pot which bears the markings of the Two Fingers, and are made with bone shards and Albinauric Blood; this suggests a spiritual power is behind the \u201cillusion\u201d, and implications regarding Albinaurics; are Albinaurics spiritual due to the \u201csilver\u201d they\u2019re made of? I remember some people suggesting that the putrescence is made of constructed people, like claymen/silver-beings as to explain the illusion and these peoples\u2019 supposed impurity according to the congealed putrescence description (the shadows are similar in appearance to Shadow Bait, a spell of the Two Fingers which suggests they may have some spiritual power, or are at least skilled conjurors; Rhia isn\u2019t far away, and they can create Shadows as servants; according to Recluse\u2019s questline one cannot live without a shadow). Putrescence at least has bones as can be seen by skeletons that animate among it, as well as the Putrescent Knight; to note, its cleaver scales off Arcane; is this due to the nature of putrescence or is it the nature of the corpses? Also to note: Silver Tear weapons do not scale with arcane, but the Silver Tear Mask improves it so\u2026 ehh?\n\n(Archaeology Speculation) The coffins are a curiosity, but are possibly predecessors to the Ancient Dynasty as they depict the same bearded man their statues depict, a bull (which is one of the dynasty\u2019s icons), and they\u2019re depicted at the top of the Dynasty Stelae. The worship of horns is also shared by the Ancestral Followers around the Dynasty ruins and Hornsent who live in the land of the coffins. The stelae also depicts trees as important, so I\u2019d presume some shaman/Hornsent connection here as both worshipped trees (Enir Ilim has trees with faces; the God who entered the gate, Marika, was presumably gifted the Erdtree\u2019s seed by the Two Fingers according to the Seed +1 Talismans; the Hornsent would presumably worship the Two Fingers, seen by the shack outside Rhia and praying corpse in Dheo, as they desired a God); also the Nox settled their cities near these ruins (they are Marika\u2019s relatives). I also have to mention the DLC concept art, that of a coffin atop Rauh\u2026 what does this mean? Were they built atop stuff and then slid down when\u2026 whatever catastrophe that happened\u2026 happened? Be it a fallen star, be it volcanos, the coffins sunk into the stone. \n\nDid the coffins once summon a God? Is that what the Hornsent is basing their massacre upon? The jarred shamans are made of accumulated flesh and can have many faces; they also fire homing flesh, and their title as shamans connotates some spiritual strength, so were they chosen above others to be massacred for being potent spiritual fuel? \n\nI was going to actually talk about Silver Tears and the Molten Tears, but those are an entirely different topic, even if Silver Tears relate to alchemy like snakes, and morph like slime.

    "body": "In the cutscene where he asks Radahn to be his consort, he also tells Radahn: \"I'm going to be a God\". I feel like people don't realize what that means. \n\nIf Miquella has already decided he's going to be a god and has set a plan in motion, then at that point he already knows about the ritual scroll. He knows that what is needed is a Lord's \\*\\*soul\\*\\* and a vessel for it. Meaning he already knew Radahn would have to die and is asking him to be his Consort \\*within that context\\*. He just asked Radahn to die. \n\n  \nThere's lore on Radahn's take on his own death, he wants to ensure he dies in honorable combat. He wants someone to kill him as he fights with all his might. He made a vow with Jerren saying this. \n\n  \nThis is what Malenia was doing in the Battle of Aeonia. The Young Lion set confirms this, since it tells us that when Malenia fought Radahn and let the scarlet flower bloom, she whispered in his ear: \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort\". She was there to kill him, per the vow. When she wakes up in the Haligtree she mentions that she is \"awaiting his return\", referring to Miquella. She knows he's off becoming a god and expects him to return with Radahn. \n\n  \nMiquella mentions \"our part of the vow\" in that flashback. That's what their part of the vow was. At the start of the Promised Consort fight, Miquella thanks both Malenia and the Tarnished for killing Radahn. Miquella and Radahn talked about the vow and Radahn agreed under the condition that he could meet his (again, necessary) death in honorable combat. \n\nThe Young Lion Armor has a Haligtree symbol on the cape and we see that during this time in his life, Radahn used the swords of Light and Lord. The descriptions of those swords imply that there's \\*something else\\* besides \"physical strength\" and \"gravity\" that Radahn relies on. It's Miquella. He uses the swords again when he becomes the Promised Consort. \n\nTo preemptively address a popular argument: people get hung up on the wording \"honorable\" combat, saying Malenia wasn't \"honorable\", but I think it just means to kill him while he's fighting his hardest in this case. But even if you don't like that, it's implied that Malenia never intended to go that far in the first place, he was simply so powerful that to kill him she had no choice but to use her hail Mary ult that literally cost her a piece of herself, just to meet his measure. And even doing that she didn't manage to kill him. \n\n  \nI think the vow with Jerren was probably made once the Battle at Aeonia was decided, to have Jerren ensure he dies \\*in combat specifically\\*. Because that's how he wants to die. ",

Thousands upon thousands of soldiers sent to their deaths, just so that Radahn can have the ego trip of fighting his hardest?

        "body": "I think the whole point of Millicent's quest is about this.\n\nMillicent's whole journey is one of having her fate altered to suit an agenda. This is done through Gowry's manipulation of the Unalloyed Gold Needle, the needle being an instrument that can weave the thread of fate. Depending on the outcome of her quest, she either succumbs to Gowry's fate and dies with the Unalloyed Gold Needle in her flesh in order to bloom,  OR she takes out the Needle and succumbs to the fate she decides for herself:\n\n&gt; \"That if I am to flower into something other than myself, I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.\" (Millicent dialogue)\n\nShe leaves behind that same instrument which weaves fate if she dies rather than bloom. Only, instead of Gowry's designs this new version of the Unalloyed Gold Needle contains Millicent's designs as reflected in its new description:\n\n&gt; \"There is something I must return to Malenia. The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.\" (3rd version of the Unalloyed Gold Needle's item description)\n\nTo bring all this back to Malenia: after she has been defeated by the player and has bloomed, we can apply Millicent's version of the Unalloyed Gold Needle to Malenia's bloom. In doing so, we have weaved Malenia's fate and returned to her that sense of \"dignity [...] that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot\". This indicates to me that her fate will now be similar to Millicent's: she would \"rather rot into nothingness\" than \"flower into something other than\" herself. So why did Malenia bloom in the first place?\n\nIt is extremely important to note that by giving Malenia's bloom Millicent's Unalloyed Gold Needle, we necessarily pull out Miquella's Needle. I think that this indicates that, just like Millicent with Gowry's Needle, Malenia's fate was manipulated with Miquella's Needle. They are both Needles, instruments that weave fate. Both Needles are engineered by someone with an agenda. The Needles purportedly grant the impaled person relief from the rot, yet at the same time when the impaled person dies with the Needle in their flesh, they bloom. The parallels here are striking, and it isn't unreasonable to believe that Miquella wanted Malenia's rot power to slay Radahn for the sake of acquiring a Consort. There is also a precedence for Miquella manipulating wills through his charm, so why not through altering fate?\n\nIn short: if Malenia is given the Unalloyed Gold Needle she will likely choose to rot away into nothingness rather than bloom into the true Goddess of Rot. If Malenia is not given the Unalloyed Gold Needle, the next and third time she is killed/betrayed, she will likely bloom into the true Goddess of Rot.",

It's also directly said that her humanity is what kept the Rot at bay, so it would be likely that the Rot would consume her. \n\nAlso keep in mind that Malenia is an Empyrean that doesn't have a twin person or other. Her existence is evidence that supports Marika not needing to have had a twin personality or other half. I'm pointing this out specifically because people say that Marika had to have always had one and it was just naturally Radagon or the Gloam Eyed Queen or someone else.",

It perhaps simply got crystalized with her blood, seeping out slowly through the decades and decades that she's been hanging there.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Since NightReign basically confirms that the world of Elden Ring and the Soulsborne universe are tied together in some way\n\n\nExcept really, it doesn't. Nightreign's director made pretty darn clear that the Dark Souls bosses are there to fill up the roster and be fun callbacks, and *not* to have any lore implications to Elden Ring itself. The Nightlord is simply able to somehow bring in characters from a totally different and seperated universe, for convenience's sake, and the nightlord doesn't even exist in Elden Ring.\u00a0\n\n\nBesides that, there is no soulsborne universe. Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne are three distinct universes. Dark Souls was basically made to be a legally distinct, new universe to make a sequel with. Bloodborne at some point seemingly was supposed to have overt references to Demon's Souls, and these were removed, seemingly to seperate it from it's predecessor.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;Maddening the queen could have been the reason Shabriri is the most hated person in history as well\n\n\nFrenzy from Elden Ring and Frenzy from Bloodborne are very much two different things. Of course frenzy/madness is a similar concept, but in Elden Ring it's all associated with this sense of burning anger, of \"how could the world be so unfair!?\". In Bloodborne the madness doesn't come from the juxtaposition of morality with reality, but from the sheer incomprehensibility of the great ones. It's your mind breaking from the juxtaposition between the reality you believed to perceive in your normal life, and the true reality that your brain is perceiving right now.\n\n\nAlso, the blood spike almost certainly entered her while she was already strung up, and this is not something people seem to even know about. Even shabriri probably can't enter the tree. The spike mirrors the sword in Hoarah Loux' stomach, which in turns mirrors the spear stabbed into Jesus' heart after his death on the cross. It makes a lot of sense that the blood spear comes from the same being that has crusified Marika.\n\n\nWhat I don't mean to imply is that there aren't useful patterns and tropes in Miyazaki's games. In the same way that we all have our own meanings and associations with words (depending on language, dialect, personal experience), artists and writers will often have symbols and visual cues that repeat in different works of theirs, and keep a lot of their meanings between works. This absolutely counts for Miyazaki.\n\n\nBuuut I think in this case the resemblance is largely coincidental. More of an art style thing than a symbolic thing.",

His role prior to the Shattering was to be the next Elden Lord but heavy is the head that wears the crown. Godwyn's story is told by those close to him but not exactly quoting from his mouth like his mom and Radagon. Everyone is telling their own perspectives and potential second hand accounts of him yet we'll never really know what he wanted. Sure he did amazing things for the Greater Will and Golden Order but we never once get some real answers from him. Ranni saw him as an obstacle in her own goals as Godwyn was destined to take the throne so had to cut him. But look at the painting of his death (above), it looks like he's on his knees. \n\nNow you could say the Black Knives knocked him down with a heavy blow but I also feel like he could have just as easily gotten back on his feet. His head is down and face obscured too, I feel like he may have willingly stayed down because it was a way out. He may have known early about Marika's want to break from the Greater Will and that sparked some interest in him but may have also juggled with his own lifetimw devotion to the Golden Order and Greater Will because he was groomed into it. So he struggled with the weight of juggling these two choices. So when he notices these people come to kill him, he decides to take this way out to end his suffering as now something not from the Greater Will is come to collect him and he won't fight back. Besides, why else would a demigod not put up a fight if they are undying, he always knew death may not come for him, that is if it was brought right to his door unexpectedly. (Idk)\n",

The time when the Erdtree poured down blessing upon the land and its people, and the realm was continually expanding through Godfrey\u2019s conquests.\n\nThis is a sharp contrast with the modern age, when the Erdtree's boughs have dried up and it \"became more an object of faith\". This is the period of the Golden Order Fundamentalists, of dogmatic zealots like D and ascetic scholars like Goldmask. They seek to study, preserve and perfect the Order as it is, stamping out any imperfections. In many ways their austere values are the ideological opposite of Godwyn\u2019s age of grace and plenty. \n\nIt's no surprise, then, that the Prince of Death arises as the ultimate foe of Golden Order Fundamentalism, and that his corrupting Deathroot shakes the inert roots back to life (in death).",

If the titular Elden Ring is the concept of Order then a critical thing to consider is what even IS the concept of Order?  Sentience existing and observing is order at the most basic level. Assigning an explanation to something that otherwise has none when it is not being observed by anything that seeks to make sense of it.\n\nI personally go a massive speculative step further (hence headcanon flair) and now think the Elden Ring is a manifestation of this most basic need of intelligent life to have some sort of control over the chaos of their surroundings.  The Greater Will reflects these needs and delivers upon the greater will of sentient consciousness: the Golden Star is sent.\n\nA snowstorm that kills your neighbor is deadly all the same, but surmising it is an angry snow god that can be invoked or quelled is a form of order and control. Scientifically understanding what causes the snowstorm so you can avoid it is a form of order and control. Order IS control, it allows for purpose when the alternative is a confounding absurdity that humankind simply cannot live with.\n\nThe game is chock full of intelligent life looking to a higher power and/or creator to tell it what to do and assign it purpose. To not do so is to accept the absurdity of ones life, suffering, and death when framed in a pre-Enlightenment sense.\n\nOh, you're scared of the unknown? You want Order? Well here's the Elden Ring, have fun. And the inevitable folly of chasing these most basic needs is exposed as self-destructive when a person is given that level of power to wield and apply Order so broadly.",

        "body": "I think the Japanese perspective really helps here. \n\n\nOrder in Elden Ring is akin to the metaphysical concept of the Tao, the Way; how things are, the fundamentals of nature and life. The literal rules of the universe. \n\n\n\nAll the gods of the game are akin to kamis, living incarnations of natural phenomena, but the Greater Will and its vassal have power over the intrinsic nature of reality itself.\n\n\nThe Elden Ring is the Order of the world made manifest and physical. Made knowable and malleable. By excising concepts from its configuration you effectively rearrange reality in its area of effect because you are changing how the world operates at a fundamental level. \n\n\n\nThe whole premise of the Tao is that the true way of the world is a bottomless mistery from which one may eternally learn and appreciate the world for what it is. That any attempt at changing or opposing The Way will inevitably end in suffering and that nothing that opposes the Tao can exist for long in the world; the main way the Tao Te King exemplifies as an upfront to nature is the search for immortality and the unnatural extension of life, for death itself is part of the Way, and all things must inevitably return to the ground.\n\n\nThe Golden Order Fundamentalists study the Elden Ring directly to decipher the mysteries of life within it, thus did they learn of the Laws of Regression and Causality, which are themselves lifted from vague ideas within the Tao Te King (that everything comes from the Tao, and thus one can learn of the Tao by understanding the world and vice versa, and that the Tao pushes everything forward since the beginning of time, in an endless reaction born of one initial motion)\n\n\nIn Shinto beliefs, flowing water is pure, while stagnant water invites Kegare (impurity/spiritual pollution). By halting the flow of life into death, the Golden Order became a stagnant pool, inevitably rotting from within.\n\n\nWhen you apply this lens on the reading of Elden Ring, the folly of it becomes apparent.\n\n\nAs a little extra nugget, one could argue that the Elden Ring mural of Farum Azula doesn't necessarily mean that the Dragons had The Elden Ring or a different configuration of it; if the Elden Ring is Order itself, the mural could easily indicate that the Dragons operate on a deeper understanding of the world's nature, and that the prehistoric world they inhabited was \"fuller\" and \"grander\", lush with concepts and rules that no longer exist and allowed for their currently alien existence (as eternal dragons made of living stone infused with gold). Its a common trope of philosophy, sociology and literature to abscribe to the past a sense of lost glory, an appeal to the nostalgia of something lost to the passage of time (Elden Ring touches on this concept more overtly with items like the Giant Crusher, a massive weapon from the past that modern man can't wield because they have become meek in comparison to their forefathers)\n\n\nThere's also the fact that Placidussax was Elden Lord, indicating a relationship with the Elden Ring, or the concept of it. Whether they were the first species to brandish the Elden Beast, or if they were so tuned to their world they knew and understood its meaning, is open to interpretation, but I personally like this reading on them. It goes well with previous depictions of Dragons in Miyazaki's works: alien prehistoric forces of nature born of a grey world before time was even a concept. A much to different world from our own current existence.",

There is a stagnation as with total order, a grand unified vision, what is the point of innovation? Elden Ring sort of shows this as well. Consider for a moment how many ruins there are in the lands between and land of shadow. Civilizations have literally been built on top of them but culturally, technologically, magically, and in most ways you can think the land does not appear to have advanced in a notable way. \n\nWhile we do not have a concrete date of Marikas rise to power and the length of time she has been in power the game leads us to believe it has been a while. Having the moniker of the Eternal sort of suggests this. Once all conflict was removed and death itself was removed you would figure that the most brilliant minds would have time to innovate or that the ruling class could push them forward. Instead we are shown this weird world where you have a variant of undead and yet all the soldiers, nobles and commoners we see look like ragged zombies themselves. If the tarnished edition adds new lore through items and possible bosses I hope something hints at the birth rate in the lands between because it would be a very interesting piece of data.",

    "body": "Revisiting this cutscene.  Let's start from the (challengable) position that From put it in there for a specific reason. On the surface, it's pointless because it is re-delivering information already given to us in multiple other places.\n\n**Miquella is asking his brother to make a promise** in person. Not that Radahn took the initiative to make a promise. This is a very important distinction when the one doing the asking demonstrably compels affection/obedience in every single other example we have of him interacting with people directly.\n\nMaybe a bit bold of a theory, but I don't think this is much of a debate.  Miquella asks Radahn for something and Radahn has to do it.  I actually find this to be extremely straightforward even though \"Was Radahn charmed?\" and the nature of Miquella's charming ability have been hotly argued as topics.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID, there are still questions:\n\n* Leda and Dane don't need the charm to be loyal to Miquella, but are affected regardless to make them accepting of the others in the party.  Miquella compelling the vow does not necessarily mean it was entirely against Radahn's wishes.\n* Does Miquella have total control over his ability to compel affection such that it is always a purposeful act, or can it happen inadvertently?\n* **Miquella compelled a promise for an act, not the act itself, which opens the door to all sorts of possibilities, including Radahn trying things to circumvent it.**\n\nRandom related questions:\n\n* Radahn and Jerren made oaths to each other for honorable deaths.  Why was that needed if he already had one with Miquella/Malenia?\n* If Radahn expected to become Miquella's Lord, why did he siege Leyndell and challenge Morgott as part of the Shattering War, something only an aspiring Lord of Marika would need to do?\n* If Radahn is satisfied by his honorable end, why is he ok with being dragged back?\n* Why would Radahn, a man obsessed with war and honorable combat, be interested in lording over an Age of Compassion?\n\nAnsbach is so convinced by the idea that Radahn wouldn't want to return that he assumes it would convince Freyja to side with him in stopping the ritual. But she is too obsessed with Radahn's warlike persona to understand the true implications and is only excited that Radahn can return and keep fighting. Totally oblivious to the fact that the Age he is returning for is to be one lacking merit-based stature and lessened/no conflict. Ansbach only laughs at how stupid Freyja is.\n\nEDIT: Our boy Ansbach would never call someone stupid, and pedantic people have taken issue with my wording.  He's saying he thought she would act a certain way based on provided information and then did the opposite, which is both amusing to him but also sort of expected.  Which some might concisely call 'being stupid'.\n\ntl;dr There are major inconsistencies to this story and what we know about Radahn, I believe it is reasonable to conclude that the vow was against his wishes.",

Only for us to end up swept up at the Limgrave beach and be saved by Melina, as she is specifically waiting for us there as we are \"the chosen Tarnished.\" This seems to have been cut for development reasons, and instead, we got the weird Chapel start, which was obviously just meant as a screenshot place like the other places from the Four Belfries.\n\nThe reason why both Melina and Morgott are there is that in the 1.00 version of the Limgrave map, Radagon prophesied that the Tarnished would return from Limgrave beach, so they both await their return, with Morgott effectively wanting to preemptively stop the invasion of his realm.\n\n\nA second story element that is important in this context is that in 1.00, Godrick's castle is actually under the control of Morgott's army, as every single 1.00 item description of Godrick's soldiers labels them as Morgott's soldiers. This is probably also part of the \"stopping the invader\" plot, and Godrick had a slightly different part in the plot that we don't really know about. So he is essentially here specifically since it was a castle under his controll at some point and they just kept him here even tho it's not longer his castle. Probably because he is just a pretty good tutorial boss and the lines about wanting to stop the tarnished still make sense in the new context.",

Nightreign is about our characters' journey through the Eclipse rebirth ritual, a ritual about returning memory after death, because in Elden Ring's world (and George R.R. Martin's) life == memory. \n\n1. The Nightring looks like a partial solar eclipse, the stage of the solar eclipse with the \"diamond ring\" effect\n2. The Eclipse is a symbol of rebirth \n3. The Eclipse rebirth ritual is about returning memories, and in Elden Ring memory = life\n4. Our Nightfarers are on a journey of regaining memories --&gt; this world is within the eclipse\n5. The Nightlord = Night King from Game of Thrones (in NR night erodes memory, NK wants to kill Three-Eyed Raven, the \"memory of the world\")\n6. The PARTIAL solar eclipse is a symbol for DEATH, and death is also symbolized by a black hole\n7. Many people in the Lands Between are performing the Eclipse rebirth ritual using \"soul hard drives\" to remember the dead to rebirth them\n8. Death, Night, Shadow, and the Abyss are all different versions of the \"dark\" \n9. Everything \"dark\" has been labeled \"sin\" and \"sealed away\" \n10. The sealing away of the dark might be the \"sin of the Erdtree\" because dark is a natural part of the world and order and getting rid of half of nature is a big no no\n11. I identify the \"root\" pattern, seen in DeathROOT, the Erdtree Roots, the Dark Souls bonfires, Great Site of Grace, the Grandmother tree,  the Swords of Light &amp; Darkness, and the stone monument on the Erdtree\n12.

A recurring concept in Dark Souls is the idea that souls are passed down and that they change.\u00a0 The strongest example is how we see the Lord Souls get passed down and evolve between DS 1 and 3.\n\n\nTypically, sins are something that we think of as attaching to the soul of the sinner.\u00a0 If runes are memories, and memories are souls, and souls can be transferred, then perhaps the \"foundation\" is not deferring responsibility to their progeny. Perhaps the nightfarers are simply the most recent recipients of the remnants of the souls of those who were part of the foundation.",

Vyke (you are here)\n\nMicrocosm analysis is taking smaller stories, regions, items, or characters and attempting to draw parallels to the main characters of the story, whom we know little about. An example is Miquella\u2019s story from the DLC being used to determine some of Marika\u2019s past. With that established, by the end of this post, I hope to use Vyke to convince you that Godwyn:\n\n* Almost became Elden Lord\n* Was a Knight of the Roundtable\n* Had 2 maidens he cared about\n* One was turned into a puppet and killed herself\n* The other was a dragon\n* Was imprisoned for associations with factions outside the Golden Order\n* Harbored doubts about Golden Order\n* Tricked into representing an outer faction in response\n\nWhy should we consider Vyke a microcosm? How is he like Godwyn?\n\n* Both love dragons\n* Both attain a high level of power before a fall from grace\n* Both end up infected\n* Both end up representative of forces outside the Golden Order despite having had places of honor within it\n\n# Vyke rejects grace because it requires he burn his maiden\n\n&gt;Iron armor singed and blistered by fingers. Worn by Vyke, knight of the Roundtable Hold. ***No other Tarnished was closer to the throne of the Elden Lord than Vyke***. But without announcement, Vyke traveled far below the capital, and was scorched by the flame of frenzy.\n\nVyke was like us, a tarnished who is rising among their talented fellows of the Roundtable Hold. Someone following the guidance of grace. \u201cNo other Tarnished was closer to the throne\u201d \u2013 I assume this means that Vyke made it all the way to the base of the Erdtree. We know he found the Subterranean Shunning Grounds, which means he made it into the heart of the city. I believe he had reason to visit these grounds because he made contact with the wall of thorns, but refused to sacrifice his maiden.\n\n&gt;You are about to sacrifice something precious. The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge. Only so that you may be Lord.\n\nWhat a horrible thing to ponder. Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not.\n\nBut how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon?\n\nShabriri may have an agenda, but he makes a good point here. The Golden Order is reliant on the sacrifice of maidens, something we should find horrifying.\n\n&gt;If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling and the girl can be spared ...setting you on the righteous path of lordship.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tapgpmzj1v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c939a6e11c0f6612c5b373936a9726cb468b77f3\n\nEven more important is another spell Vyke uses. In fact, he\u2019s the only one that ever casts it \u2013 Frenzied Burst. This spell tells us a lot. It tells us that Vyke is one of the few to establish some semblance of control over the frenzy flame. He\u2019s powerful enough to resist the madness to create this spell. Sage Midra also resists for quite some time. Both fight chaos and win at least one battle, even if they eventually lose the war.\n\n# Why would he inhibit his newfound powers?\n\n&gt;In the days of the past, a crown was warranted with strength.\n\nExcept for SL0 sickos, the mantra above applies to the vast majority of players who become Elden Lord. It\u2019s what happens when the main mechanic of your game is combat.\n\nSo why do we first find Vyke at the Church of Inhibition? Why would he inhibit himself? That\u2019s not usually how one becomes Lord.\n\n[An angry spirit Vyke defending a church of Marika](https://preview.redd.it/g7p9ydvr1v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=385dc7606ef4681df0d571c2cc10790e31b8de78)\n\nThe skeptical might say something like, \u201cHe\u2019s not holding back. He is seeking control.\u201d or \u201cHe got caught before he could really use his powers\u201d\n\nBut Lord Contender Vyke, he who we find jailed in the mountains, proves he is holding back. He holds back our entire fight with him. In fact, he seems to have gotten better at it. Not only is this Vyke a real human instead of a red phantom, he does not use any madness incants like his phantom. You might think this is an older version of Vyke, but this version also has the fingerprint armor on.\n\n[Notice the fingerprint burns. Their location is also important](https://preview.redd.it/7sgoknlz1v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1213926028463eb1a3632d3378e774e839d6c8e0)\n\nThis version of Vyke has been dealing with madness since he first caught it, assumedly a long time ago. Yet he doesn\u2019t seem to be impacted by it at all. Why would a champion of the frenzy flame spurn its use? This goes beyond control and veers into suppression. But why doesn\u2019t he use the power of the flame that he pursued at such cost? Why would he change his mind so drastically?\n\n# He didn\u2019t consent to the frenzy flame. He was grabbed from behind.\n\nVyke never wanted to use the flame on principal, he wanted to avoid sacrificing his maiden. Like Midra and Yura, he is a pawn in a larger game. Unlike us, he is not a willing one. You can tell because the angle and imprint pattern of the fingerprints on Vyke\u2019s armor only make sense if he was grabbed from behind.\n\n[The melting is more on the back than the front and that is illustrated in the art to the right](https://preview.redd.it/v0gtr30k2v4g1.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e4630ebc4f538c2ffa8df76afbf95eb42258584)\n\nBy the time we meet the 3 Fingers, the forces of madness have learned better. They now know that a willing lord is far better than one who is coerced or tricked.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr3or02o2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0422301895f175b5ca15d1b614c0d46f09cf3523\n\nVyke had armor on because they knew they could not get him to disrobe. That requires trust. Vulnerability. He was not bought into this deal as a full partner. Vyke\u2019s armor is the best proof we have that the full story is being withheld from him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xkgct8gp2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c64082e718ec3cc9c4af1747e1e7d5bb9f76dfa\n\nIt mentions mysterious forces at play. It implies his stated reason for taking the flame was his maiden, so we can assume she was involved in this discussion. Her story is fascinating. It\u2019s difficult to know much for sure, but filenames confirm that she is the dead finger maiden we find in the Church of Inhibition.\n\n[The maiden sits still in her chair near a statue of Marika](https://preview.redd.it/1tl5sbxr2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c55cf170399e2cc66b89371bb5ab9e8140b187e)\n\nVyke went out of his way to save her, yet still failed. He took on a terrible curse, got jailed for it, and yet she ends up dead anyways\u2026in a church of all places.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/st1h0yvx2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2825f557539388f0f8bda33ef812464849cc4fd\n\nCloser inspection shows a bloody maiden holding one of her wrists. We know this is blood because we can use it to progress Varr\u00e9's quest. We can also loot her outfit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tvr58zy2v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0db433d9b8aef683c3149d824dfd88f8af8bf2d0\n\nIn this church we also find a Marika statue and a Sacred Tear, a holy chalice similar to our flask. The tear item description also mentions guaranteed blessings of the Erdtree, something echo\u2019d in the finger maiden\u2019s \u2018assurances\u2019. This is a lot of smoke when it comes to the Erdtree having great influence over the fate of Vyke\u2019s maiden.\n\nBut much doubt is cast on the Erdtree\u2019s real power.\n\n&gt;Or did some other force lure him with suggestion? (fingerprint armor)\n\n&gt;Or at least, such was the promise long ago (finger maiden clothing)\n\n&gt;theirs *was once* a certain blessing (sacred tear)\n\nLet us recall that grace is not the only light finger maidens can follow. If Vyke\u2019s finger maiden was like ours, she would have been a follower of the 3 fingers by the time they journeyed to the tomb of the dead god below Lleyndell. More importantly, if she was like Hyetta, she would have pushed Vyke to ascend. Showed him the way.\n\nWhat if this is the false power that lures Vyke? Madness is often mistaken for the power of the Erdtree in many other items. Maybe his maiden hid the fact that she was no longer following the grace of gold, but now sought a different light. There is some reason he is not asked to take off his armor, and ultimately it can be attributed to a lack of trust. But why lie to him in the first place? Maybe it\u2019s because she knew Vyke would never agree to destroy the world. Maybe he had his own Melina, someone keeping him anchored to the current world, no matter how broken.\n\n# He had another love - Ancient Dragon Lansseax\n\nThe key to Vyke\u2019s story is understanding that his finger maiden is not the only one he\u2019s trying to save. The golden order would have him kill an innocent woman he travels with. The flame of frenzy would have him kill the woman he loves. He\u2019s been put in a no-win situation. Ultimately, it destroys him.\n\n[Did Godwyn open the roundtable to dragons and their allies?](https://preview.redd.it/ipm24nl63v4g1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae7720900ce91bcfe53d46331d6a2658e3b22ecd)\n\n# Applying it to Godwyn\n\nLet's revisit key elements of Vyke's story and see what they say about Godwyn.\n\n**Both almost became Elden Lord**\n\nBoth are lord contenders. Vyke for madness, Godwyn for death. Both fail to become aught at all.\n\n&gt;Ahh, Lord Vyke, it seems that you were no lord, after all. Then where is he? Our true Lord, our Lord of Frenzied Flame.\n\n**Both had two maidens**\n\nOne was turned into a puppet and killed herself. For Vyke this is his finger maiden. For Godwyn this is Ranni. One was an ancient dragon. For Vyke this is Lansseax. For Godwyn this is Fortisax.\n\n**Both were part of an expansion of the Roundtable**\n\nWhen Godfrey left, Godwyn was still around. With his father gone, Godwyn would be the first in line to inherit his father's position as commander of the roundtable knights, still ultimately in service of Marika. It\u2019s easy to see how Godwyn would be the first to invite dragons. This could have been an effort to extend status to other peoples, liek the Tarnished, and would have been loathed by the Golden Order diehards.\n\n**Both were imprisoned for associations with factions outside the Golden Order**\n\nVyke harbored doubts about the Golden Order\u2019s willingness to sacrifice young women. I see no reason to think Godwyn couldn\u2019t come to the same conclusion if he was in an arranged marriage. This is made worse by Godwyn &amp; Vyke consorting with ancient dragons, well known competitors of the Golden Order in both religion and area control.\n\nI propose that, despite strong attachment to the Golden Order via the Roundtable, these two heroes could not abide what was asked of them. The cost of being a lord was too high. This disillusionment ends up being exploited by malicious forces, those looking to score political gains and advance their own agendas.\n\nThis happens often in the real world as well. The people being used often take the fall for any political or criminal fallout, which we see ultimately sink Vyke &amp; Godwyn.",

The fight with Godrick? Godrick grafts on the head of a dragon that has already been killed. The fight with Rennala? She summons spirit dragons, and also there's a glintstone dragon right in the path of the glintstone key needed to enter Raya Lucaria. And then obviously the Vyke route would be to fight Magma Wyrm Makar and have a sparring match with Lansseax (it's a scripted event that she leaves before being killed), rather than taking the lift. These also happen to be the two demigods on the critical path if someone were to strictly follow the direction of the rays of grace to Leyndell and search in the smallest possible radius for ways to access Raya Lucaria and to find the Ruin Strewn Precipice as an alternative to ascend to Altus Plateau.\n\nBoth locations also have significance to the death of Godwyn, as the Prince of Death's Pustule is found at Stormveil and Ranni who was responsible for Godwyn's death is encountered in Raya Lucaria.",

    "body": "Throughout the years, a predominant interpretation by well-respected loreheads in this community is one that I have gripe with. The idea that the Black Knives are somehow a group acting of their own volition disagreeable to me. That they are independent of their master(s) and that they act for purely personal reasons. That their pursuit of Ranni is 'revenge' for being used in The Night of The Black Knives, as if they have an interest in vengeance to begin with. That they slew those finger maiden crones for any reason other than being given an order to do so.\n\nIn my view, this interpretation misses the intentionally 'formless' characterization of these assassins. The only pieces of information that we've been given about the Black Knives as people are as follows;\n\n\\- They have names (Alecto, for example)\n\n\\- They have a race (Numen)\n\n\\- They have associations (Marika and Ranni)\n\n\\- They act in self preservation (Fleeing the capital)\n\n\\- They slew Godwyn (and presumably others)\n\nThere really isn't anything which dictates that they are individuals with complex motivations and values. That they're still just people who happen to have pieces of the Rune of Death.\n\nThe reality is that the Black Knives are more analogous to the Nazg\u00fbl of The Lord of The Rings series. They are clearly inspired by them. Both creatures are formless humanoids draped in black hoods that cover invisible faces. They both wield unnatural power granted to them by rings (The Rune of Death is a Great Rune, Great Runes are rings of the Elden Ring). They both wield deadly weapons that can inflict damage on one's very soul; that can turn someone into a mindless husk if their affliction pierces deep enough (Godwyn and Frodo). They both act(ed) on the behest of a powerful being without an actual body (Ranni and Sauron).\n\nWhile they aren't exactly 1:1 copies of the Nazg\u00fbl, there's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is another commonality between these two groups of wraiths as well; service to a master. No, Ranni isn't Sauron. Nor is Marika for that matter, but the similarities are hard to ignore when it comes to the immortal foot soldiers that they command. These assassins have been corrupted by the power they wield, pieces of the Elden Ring, and subservience to a greater will was the cost.\n\nI'll leave it at that for now. I'd like to see people's thoughts on the matter.\n\n\n\n",

I've done a long post about this, but I believe the BKA's are all Silver Tears of Marika herself (or at the very least, loyal to her). Whether Ranni knew this or not is irrelevant. \n\nThey are all numen women with close ties to Marika, their faces/identities are all concealed, they have long blonde hair, and you can easily take the locations we find them in to suggest that they are working on behalf of Marika. For example, they attack Ranni and her followers only after Ranni makes her final moves in her plan to supplant Marika. We also find them just Ordina Liturgical Town locked up in an Evergaol. You could infer that they were locked up trying to assassinate Miquella, who also plans to supplant Marika.\n\nOn top of all this, there is also the dialogue of the Finger Reader in the Deeproot Depths:  \n*\"My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.*  \n*As the first of the demigods to die.*  \n*As a martyr to Destined Death.\"*  \nThis can be read a lot of ways, but I look at as if Marika intended Godwyn to act as a Martyr for Destined Death.\n\nEdit: Oh, and for anyone who might say \"the BKA's can't be silver tears because of Alecto and Tiche being mother and daughter\", silver tears can absolutely \"reproduce\", in a manner of speaking.

The briars can be used to attack foes.\"\n\nRight away we are given several subjects...\n\n- The Briars of Sin\n- Rebirth\n- Repose of the Soul\n\nWhat does this tell us? Well essentially it seems that the Briar Maiden was guilty of something as Briars of Sin reveals:\n\n\"The guilty, their eyes gouged by thorns, lived in eternal darkness. There, they discovered the blood star.\"\n\nThis tells us right away that the Briar Maiden was guilty of something. For this she had her eyes crushed by deadly briars and was forced to walk in Eternal Darkness for her punishment. \n\nThe presence of Briars also possibly implies a strong connection to the Blood Star, and by possible extension the Mother of Truth.\n\nAside from her these thorns are featured on the Fire Guardian Hags likely signifying some connection between these two parties. In essence it begs the question of what are these hags guilty of if they are in-service to the Erdtree. A service that would ensure the trees longevity at that.\n\nAnother possessor of Briars is Elemer, another foreigner who himself was set to be Executed if it weren't for the downfall of House Marais. His gear reads:\n\n\"Battered iron armor from a foreign land. Worn by Elemer of the Briar. \n\nThe winding, rusted iron briars are a mark of the guilty and typically indicate a sentence of death.\n\nElemer murdered numerous instructors and merchants, and was known as the Bell Bearing Hunter.\"\n\n~ Briar Armor\n\nAgain we are given the subjects of Guilt and foreign nature. Elemer originates from Eochaid and for whatever reason he was sent ALL THE WAY to TLB to be killed. Why? \n\nThat brings us to our next subjects: Rebirth and Repose of the Soul.\n\nWhy The Lands Between, ignoring differences between real world and fictional economies, wouldn't it cost less to just kill them where they were? Perhaps but what if I told you that they were only meant to die to be reborn. If we take another look at the Shield of the Guilty it mentions:\n\n\"Shield made to venerate a maiden whose eyes were crushed by Briars of Sin before being reborn in these lands.\"\n\nTo be reborn requires that one must have died, even in the metaphorical sense, something must be given up to gain new shape. And it's not like this isn't something that happens regularly in TLB anyways:\n\n\"Amber egg clutched by Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon.\nGreat Rune of unborn demigods.\n\nPerfects those who have been born anew.\n\nChildren born anew by Rennala are all frail and short-lived. Imperfect beings, each and all.\"\n\nIn fact we see a myriad of enemies in game that have seemingly been reborn into new shapes, and each of them drops a Larval Tear. In order for this rebirth to be reversed the creatures new form in question must be destroyed to revert. This loosely connects Death with transformation (though then again it could just be a gameplay mech who knows?)\n\nBut lastly to tie this together are the Lulling Branch and the Slumbering Egg:\n\n\"In the midst of drowsiness, there is the will to awaken.\nFeelings that rise from the depths of one's heart.\"\n\n\"Owl eggs that will never hatch.\nMaterial used for crafting items.\n\nPrized as a symbol of the most sublime slumber.\"\n\nIn previous posts I detail how Sleep the domain of St. Trina has intrinsic connections to Death which is countered by Miquella's connection to \"waking,\" birth or what we collectively reference as Nascency.\n\nBoth operate as vital parts of the cycle of rebirth one bringing rest to that which whithers, while the other rouses new life into birth.\n\nThe line mentioned on the shield:\n\n\"Venerating the repose of the soul\"\n\nSeems to be referencing directly the subject mentioned prior in the same item: the concept of being reborn.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nI have come to believe that The Lands Between are indeed a Penal Colony, and that Death only washes ashore to be reborn in some way into a more suitable acceptable form. This would even seem to explain the Zealotry of the Hornsent who Jar the Maidens.\n\nIf indeed there was some history here wherein the Shaman would, \"Make Saints of Criminals\" who came there, we can kinda see how it could turn for the worst if perhaps a previous order had been deposed.\n\nTo put it concisely: The Shaman were likely Wardens of a Penal Colony, and could have suffered a disaster which tilted the scales out of their favor making the prison (rehabilitation center?) they once held into cage for themselves. \n\nTo back this up I'll even bring up the Winged Scythe:\n\n\"According to pagan belief, white-winged maidens are said to be Death's gentle envoys.\"\n\nThe Deathbirds were no doubt Matriarchal given that their only progenitor given was a Mother in the Form of the Twinbirds. And here we are again given the concept of femininity in connection with Death. The Deathbed companions, Trina, Melina, Ranni and even Malenia and her Valkyries. \n\nThis paints a picture of a Matriarchal Land of Death and if one has Death, it must be tempered and defined by Life. The line connecting these two? Rebirth. \n\nBonus bit:\n\nThis got me to thinking also about the Biblical Story of Cain and Abel. To keep it short, after Cain kills his Brother he is sent to \"The Land of Nod,\" and if one where to look up the meaning of the word Numen/Numina:\n\n\"Etymologically, the word means \"a nod of the head\", here referring to a deity as it were \"nodding\", or making its will or its presence known.\"\n\nJust some food for thought. I hope you enjoyed my ramblings, please lmk what you think! And as always HAPPY LORE HUNTING!!!",

But then the game also gives deathbirds and death rite birds an attack that inflicts deathblight, which presents a serious issue for my previous sentence: deathbirds are ancient, and *looong* predate not just the NoBK, but the entire Age of the Erdtree! So how can they be related to something that supposedly originates so much later than they do?\n\nI've seen various theories over the years that attempt to address this. \"Deathblight actually predates the NoBK.\" \"The deathbirds and/or Death itself have been corrupted.\" etc. But have we considered the possibility that the deathblight the deathbirds inflict ... isn't *actually* deathblight?\n\nDeathbirds and death rite birds have only one attack that inflicts deathblight: a high-pitched screech that also deals damage in a small area. (Their animations look like the screech they perform before their grab might also inflict deathblight, but I was unable to verify whether that animation has a hitbox.) It's *just* their screech: none of their other attacks inflict deathblight, none of their relevant item descriptions mention deathblight, and none of them drop deathroot or are found in deathroot-infested areas.\n\nUndead with a scream that causes death [aren't something FromSoft invented from scratch](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurBansheesAreLouder). What I'm proposing is that the deathbirds' cry has **nothing** to do with Elden Ring's deathblight, but is instead simply a reference to banshees (the modern pop culture version, not the original Celtic bean s\u00eddhe). FromSoft wanted these enemies to have a sonic attack that could instantly kill the player, and so rather than implement an entirely new mechanic just for the deathbirds, they just used the insta-kill mechanic they already had: deathblight.\n\nThis would neatly explain why deathblight and deathroot don't appear **anywhere** in any other deathbird/death rite bird-related lore, or ghostflame lore, or any other ancient undead lore: because deathblight didn't exist when the deathbirds were keepers of Death; it's \"\"\"just\"\"\" a banshee's cry.",

While no new addition to Elden Ring as a whole, it is far more consistent here, with nearly every Nightfarer connecting to this concept in some way. More than that, though, it is reflective of a critical element of FromSoft\u2019s approach to storytelling, and the relationship between their games.\n\n|\n\nNaturally, considering this idea in the context of the Nightfarers, the first that comes to mind is the Wylder, who uses a Larval Tear to take Heolstor\u2019s place and become the new lumbering, nameless, primordial Nightlord. In order to do so, he fights a Mimic Tear in the Nox city of Noklateo, after having found a crucial scrap of paper inside the Duchess\u2019s Nox-style chest in the Crypt. In a very literal sense, he abandons his original self to take on the identity and form of another, adopting a cursed duty so that the Duchess may survive.\n\nSpeaking of, while the Duchess does not technically take on another person\u2019s identity, she does alternate between two personas: her own, real self, the Duchess, and the more reserved, ceremonial role of the Priestess. She even subdues her natural accent when speaking as the Priestess, taking on a slightly more neutral, formal voice. As the Duchess, she is free to \u201c*get \\[her\\] hands dirty*,\u201d and speak from the heart; as the Priestess, though, she serves a defined role, fulfilling a solemn duty, and is bound to the Roundtable Hold. She is, in essence, living in an identity not truly her own.\n\nOn the note of solemn duty which \u201c*weighs upon the one beholden; not unlike a gnawing curse from which there is no deliverance*,\u201d the Revenant is another immediately obvious case of one individual adopting the identity of another, as the animated doll Daphne not only bears the likeness of the murdered girl Chloe, but initially believes herself to outright be the spirit of Chloe. Daphne\u2019s entire existence is defined by Chloe, in both life and death, as well as the curse of vengeance that drives her forward as the Revenant.\n\nSimilarly, the Raider is revealed, in his own Remembrances, not to be the renowned pirate White Horn, as the Iron Menial mistakenly identifies him, but rather White Horn\u2019s infamous rival/partner, Black Claw. In the wake of White Horn failing to meet his final challenge, having been consumed by the Night, Black Claw donned his rival\u2019s iconic garb, carrying on his legacy until such a day as he could properly lay White Horn\u2019s memory to rest in appropriate fashion.\n\nThe Iron Menial himself is, at one point, impersonated by the Recluse\u2019s old colleague, the Witch of the Wheel. Even once she reveals herself, she adopts the appearance of the Recluse, albeit in slightly different attire, which she leaves to the Recluse after the latter embraces the shadow infant they created, honoring the Witch\u2019s desire for the Night to be accepted and nurtured.\n\nThe Ironeye never technically takes on a new identity, but he does face two figures which bear his own appearance. The first, a \u201cNight Huntsman,\u201d is a version of the Ironeye himself from another world, one who fell to the power of the Night; the second is the traitor who the Ironeye was tasked by the Fellowship to seek out and kill, a fellow assassin known as the Monster, who wears the same attire as the Ironeye, presumably owing to their shared affiliation with the Fellowship. Both literally and symbolically, the Ironeye must kill his own self to mark out his own path, escape the bonds that have restrained him, and indulge in an endless Night of sweet death.\n\nIn stark opposition, the Executor savors every fight out of reverence for life, and stands as a fusion of lives and selves. A spirit-attuned painter from the Land of Reeds, and the Crucible Knight who defied his orders to kill her, melded into one being, resulting in much of the Executor\u2019s story hinging on the gradual process of interrogating and untangling the nature of his present self. He does not take on the identity of another; he is the result of two others taking each other\u2019s identity unto themselves.\n\nFinally, there is the Guardian, the exception to the rule, for he is perhaps only Nightfarer who doesn\u2019t directly interface with the idea of taking on a new identity; however, this, in and of itself, ties into his core theme of standing firm, remaining planted and stoic and unwavering. Indeed, a key part of his story involves him coming to grips with realizing the true identity of someone he thought he knew, highlighting this contrast between his own unswaying nature and the fluid identities of his comrades.\n\n|\n\nThis throughline relates to how the darkness of the Night obscures truth and distinction. The Iron Menial notes how \u201c*Those who fare against the Night find that even their most cherished memories eventually dissipate,*\u201d and the Priestess speaks of how the Night\u2019s \u201c*heavy rains harry \\[the Lands Between\\], threatening to wash away its very history*.\u201d Even in base Elden Ring, one finds the Celestial Dew, stated to be known alternatively as a Night Tear, which washes away the memory of one\u2019s transgressions in the basin of the Church of Vows. Any wrongdoing can be cleansed in this manner, and indeed, the Night\u2019s Tide subsumes all equally; as observed by Libra, ever-obsessed with balance, if \u201c*the night swallows all, then the night is impartial. The night is a thing of fairness, of equanimity.*\u201d And just as all are washed away in the spirit-waters of the Night, as Dark Souls II\u2019s Agdayne tells, \u201c*the embrace of death awaits all things. It is equitable, accepting. We will all, one day, be welcomed by her embrace*.\u201d When all are embraced and consumed in such a way, when all definition and history is eroded, the lines between identities, the point where one ends and another begins, become blurred and unclear.\u00a0\n\nBut another key element that this ties into is that of cycles. Both the Nox and Carians, each closely associated with the powers of night, spirits, magic, and flowing water, emphasize themes of cycles and the reinvention of the self. The rising and setting of one moon to give way to the next; the flow of water into a basin, before flowing out into the next vessel. The concept of self-made, cyclical rebirth, both in a metaphorical sense relating to the passing of power and duty from one generation to the next, and in a literal sense relating to actual transformation and reincarnation.\n\nThe latter is a \u201c*forbidden rite*\u201d and \u201c*grim art*,\u201d in Miriel\u2019s words, yielding a rebirth which is \u201c*as sleep to \\[those dependent upon it\\], and with each awakening, memory fades into oblivion*.\u201d Along this same line, the slumber of St. Trina is symbolized by water lilies whose description states, \u201c*Like a syrupy poison, its nectar lulls the imbiber into sweet, velvety sleep,*\u201d while the concoction crafted by Thiollier in reverent imitation induces true oblivion. Sleep as a whole is described as being \u201c*like a lullaby, or a quagmire*,\u201d one which \u201c*irresistibly draws its victims down*.\u201d Meanwhile, chief among the incredibly few enemies capable of inducing sleep is Nightreign\u2019s enigmatic Augur, the Nightlord known as Maris, Fathom of Night. A great, aquatic being from the stars which wields tidal waves as attacks, its appearance and mechanics closely resemble real jellyfish and the cyclical rebirth-like processes they naturally undergo. The official Twitter post announcing its Everdark Sovereign variant invokes phrases such as \u201c*dreamless abyss*\u201d and \u201c*sunken cradle*,\u201d language all the more noteworthy given Trina\u2019s 1.00 title of \u201cSt. Trina of the Cradlesong.\u201d Even the Grace which restores the Tarnished back to life always does so upon the next morning, never at night. It is abundantly clear that, within the themes of Elden Ring, sleep is alike to death, and awakening a form of rebirth.\n\nIn a similar vein, sorcerers outside Carian purview utilize Primal Glintstones to transfer their souls from one vessel to another, dying in the process. \u201c*The old sorcerers would slice open their hearts with these blades to imbue a primal glintstone with their soul, and thus did they die*.\u201d Sellen's Primal Glintstone bears a fetus-like impression in the center, making the notion of rebirth even more literal. Given she has one to begin with, it can be safely assumed even the body the Tarnished first meets her in is not her original, though there is reason to believe her appearance is yet her own. \u201c*The stars of the night sky once guided fate*,\u201d as it is stated, and repeatedly, the intertwined powers of the stars and the Night are related to the idea of identity and memory flowing from one vessel to another, a necessary cycle if one wishes not to be subsumed and dissolved altogether within the watery depths.\n\nNightreign connects to this even further; every expedition follows the rising and setting of the sun and moon, a cycle of celestial bodies, a waxing and waning. Day gives way to night, which yields to the next day. Each renewal of the cycle is a rebirth, and the legacy of all is preserved through a chain of reinvention. Characters carry on the legacy and memory of the past by adopting the mantle of their predecessors, keeping the cycle going, allowing the waters of one night to flow into the next. All of this ties perfectly into how the Nightfarers are maintaining this fight against the eventide forces of the Night on behalf of their ancestors, bearing the sin-born obligations of the original cutting-gifted tribe; one generation reborn into the next, the will of the elder forging the potential of the younger into a weapon. As put in the Lost Ashes of War\u2019s description: \u201c*Empty ashes of war, devoid of any memories of battle. Unable to apply any kind of affinity in their current state, but can be used by Smithing Master Hewg of the Roundtable Hold to recreate other ashes. Thus does the copy pass into becoming the genuine article.*\u201d\n\n|\n\nBy the Priestess\u2019s words, the Nightfarers are guided by a \u201c*formless master*,\u201d though one of the promotional posts made prior to the game\u2019s release curiously implies the \u201c*formless master*\u201d is, in fact, leading the forces of Night. Such would be fitting, given the Night\u2019s own formless nature, its capacity to subsume and meld with its surroundings, to reflect, to mimic. All of this is expressed particularly overtly in Maris\u2019s expedition description: \u201c*It makes an ocean of its surroundings, that it may blend with whatever life is found, as if in a dream*.\u201d Liquid is formless, taking the shape of its vessel. One thinks easily of the Lands Between\u2019s various divine elements, whose natures and prospective orders are shaped by their vessels, and a cut content item called the Dried Droplet states: \u201c*Power of Night that failed to acquire a host. Droplets that sought to intermingle, and gathered in anticipation of a fitting host's welcome, only to be abandoned.*\u201d The Night is consistently related to the dissolution and melding of liquid essence; the enigmatic Nightfolk also come to mind, those who \u201c*were said to bleed silver long ago*,\u201d as well as the related Mimic Tears, beings of liquid silver who quite directly take on the forms of others.\n\nNightreign even brings back the Mimics of Dark Souls via the Symbol of Avarice, obtained from Libra, a \u201c*goat-headed being who pretends to be a man, said to be able to use a dubious form of alchemy*.\u201d Alchemy is inherently a practice focused on the transformation and ascension of the base into the divine, and indeed Libra is fixated upon the concept that \u201c*for anything to reach a higher plane each side must elevate the other*.\u201d The Night is formless, and thus impartial and equitable in swallowing all. Appropriate, that the Madness-wielding Libra would be drawn to this, for it is very much alike to the Frenzied Flame in that regard. An equitable consumption of all, yet not the conscientious egalitarianism of Goldmask\u2019s orderly philosophy, but rather a thoughtless, chaotic erasure of division. And, as it so happens, the story of the Frenzied Flame features one character taking the form of another, with Yura\u2019s deceased body being possessed by Shabriri. Spirit transferal is fairly common in Elden Ring, but uniquely, this instance does not alter the possessed individual\u2019s visage, or even voice; Shabriri obviously speaks in a very different manner from Yura, but the voice actor remains the same. A figure of the present, subsumed by a will from the past.\n\nWe see this thread carried on in an inverse manner via Ranni, whose doll body is modeled after her mentor, the snowy crone, who can be quite safely inferred to be Renna, elder sister to Rennala and Rellana, completing the Triple Goddess archetype of \u201cmaiden, mother, and crone,\u201d and explaining the \u201cThree Sisters\u201d label for the area Ranni operates out of. The Triple Goddess is associated with phases of the moon, the cyclical shifting of form and duty, the passing of knowledge and purpose from one generation to the next. All rather familiar, and with Ranni, we even see the youth inherit the elder\u2019s very form; unlike most of the cases otherwise seen, though, this is not only entirely volitional, but serves Ranni\u2019s purposes, rather than Renna\u2019s. She may have adopted the knowledge and form of her predecessor, but Ranni\u2019s will and intent remain fully her own, embodying the most balanced and conscientious example of cyclical, cross-generational rebirth across both games, as she weaves her night into being.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q2p2mikdn4g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5296c684c35998391b2e848b60cf87c1e6efff4\n\nOf course, as with most of FromSoft\u2019s work, traces of these ideas can be found in their previous titles. Bloodborne, too, focuses on cyclical nights and the interplay between deathly slumber and waking rebirth. And the very first NPC the Hunter interacts with, the kind doctor Iosefka, is eventually supplanted by an impostor who steals her appearance and home, to further her own research into the Great One known as Formless Oedon, a cosmic god of blood whose namesake rune closely resembles Marika\u2019s own, evocative not only of Nightreign\u2019s \u201c*formless master*,\u201d but of other gods of blood, such as Elden Ring\u2019s Formless Mother and Dark Souls II\u2019s Nahr Alma. Between the deities themselves and their associated families/factions, often the primary means by which players may invade others, a throughline theme exists here, of occult kinship justifying invasive acts of depraved violence. As it happens, the Iosefka impostor ends up impregnated with Oedon\u2019s malformed child, while his implied offspring, the Moon Presence, bears a striking resemblance to the swelling mass seen in the distant sky in Nightreign, noted by some for its own resemblance to certain pregnancy imagery. Further of note, it is viewed from the Spirit Shelter, a place of rest for those of \u201c*no shared station, era, or even purpose*,\u201d a flock \u201c*far from whole, imbalanced and uneven*,\u201d but who are nonetheless bound by a shared will, united in common cause to selflessly protect and preserve life. The direct inverse of the Brotherhood of Blood, Cainhurst Vilebloods, and Mohgwyn Dynasty; deliberate subversion is, itself, a form of reinvention and iteration, and thus even this contrast falls along the trail of recurring themes.\n\nFurther in line with these themes, Dark Souls III sees the conclusion to the story of Dark Sun Gwyndolin. Even from his first appearance in Dark Souls, Gwyndolin is heavily defined by her filial duty to her father, Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight. He is content to remain in the shadows, guiding the Blades of the Darkmoon and orchestrating the perpetuation of Gwyn\u2019s will and legacy. Centuries later, she has taken up leadership of what remains of the godly clan Gwyn established, gathering them in the city of Irithyll, perpetually draped in a chill night, under the crescent light of the Darkmoon, the very same seen in Nightreign\u2019s mysterious variation of the Elden Ring. Even now, however, Gwyndolin still deliberately preserves her father\u2019s legacy; \u201c*Heirdom taketh many forms, indeed*,\u201d as his adoptive younger sister, Yorshka, states, and much like how Gwyndolin\u2019s spiritual successor, Miquella, unintentionally becomes his mother, too naive to avoid her same errors, Gwyndolin too is bound by devotion to the system of power he was born into, a position that affords her the privilege of living as she desires, yet obliges him to sustain the social stratification that renders such a thing a matter of privilege.\n\nUltimately, she has her very being consumed, and his visage stolen, by a formless individual, the wretched and amorphous Aldrich, Saint of the Deep. Though little elaborated upon, the Deep is most manifest at the end of time, when the sky is dominated by an eclipse, bleeding light which takes on a bleached, lusterless hue in a certain ending; an image that is nearly identical to the eclipse insignia of Elden Ring\u2019s Mausoleum Knights and Castle Sol, and to the Primordial Nightlord\u2019s Rune. A grim symbol that overlooks the passing of one age, and the foundation of its successor. Indeed, it feels quite pertinent that Gwyndolin is, perhaps, the FromSoft character most reinvented, with the most spiritual successors; from Gwyndolin herself, to Quella, to Lothric, to the Orphan of Kos, to Miquella, and even now to Gnoster. This concept of spiritual lineage, one generation giving way to the next, which itself is shaped and defined by the legacy of its predecessor, is central to FromSoft\u2019s creative ethos as a whole. It is, truly, a key aspect of their storytelling style.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vg5ueandn4g1.png?width=1878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b917b40a49eda3c33da442bd386e4912a55993e\n\nThe reiteration of certain concepts, or even certain names or designs, exploring different angles of the same core idea; this is how FromSoft weaves their worlds together. Darkmoon Knightess, Lucatiel, and Malenia possess distinct parallels to one another, the enmity of Gough and Kalameet parallels that of Igon and Bayle, and shades of every \u201cLevel-Up Lady\u201d Heroine can be seen in every other. There are countless connections to be drawn across games, and it is exceptionally fitting that Nightreign would be the one to most overtly embody this theme, considering how it, most of all, stands as an homage to FromSoft\u2019s legacy, and the Dark Souls trilogy in particular. Though never explicitly acknowledged, the Priestess\u2019s mention of \u201c*other worlds*\u201d afflicted by the Night implies an explanation for the presence of Dark Souls entities in Limveld, but their inclusion is no arbitrary matter, with deliberate associations between certain figures tying into the overarching themes. Adel is a clear spiritual successor to both the Imperfect and the Gaping Dragon, and so the latter\u2019s presence in Nightreign becomes all the more significant. The Everdark version of Maris is fought using the Storm Ruler, hearkening most of all to the Storm King of Demon\u2019s Souls, an aquatic beast of tremendous size flying through the air. Fulghor\u2019s monstrous arm evokes not only Gundyr specifically, but also Manus, the Cleric Beast, and the Demon of Hatred, forming a prominent series of bosses that all represent the theme of once-noble champions succumbing to base, bestial corruption. Even the Nightfarers\u2019 unlockable Dark Souls skins are matched in accordance with their unique natures and the ways they echo past characters. Each of these connections serves not merely as fanservice, but to inform and recontextualize our reading of these stories.\u00a0\n\nAnd, indeed, these are *our* readings; in various interviews, Hidetaka Miyazaki has often spoken about how much of his creative works are inspired by the experience of growing up not with video games, but rather novels, gamebooks, and TTRPGS, many of which were either intended for older audiences, or written in English, leading him to only halfway understand the plot, yet inspiring him to fill in the gaps with his own imagination. His works are meant to evoke this experience. We are meant to interpret these worlds for ourselves, to co-author the text, to an extent, whether in puzzling out the obscure lore, or making our own choices throughout the games themselves. There is a reason every soulsborne game establishes the player\u2019s version of the story as being but one among countless alternate worlds. Every protagonist is canon, every choice is canon, and every ending is canon, because the story is ours to define, and every story spirals into the next. For what else is a story, but a formless dream, passed from the one who created it to those who would share it, and shaped by the vessels that now bear it?",

If the Weave could be defined as the natural flows of the energies of the world, the Shadow Weave was the embodiment of the return flows.[5] It was like veins compared to the true Weave's heart, the conductive coating around a bright conduit of energy. It could varyingly be described as leaning on, calling on, being built on, clinging to, feeding off, and echoing the Weave. In short, it was a \"shadow\" of the Weave, and by its very nature as a shadow could never be greater than the Weave itself, although it did prove superior in select areas, such as compulsion and destruction.  \n\n\nMy question is for the RPG people and the DM's out there...

I consider this to be the most likely answer, simply because I find that it makes the most sense and there is more reasoning and links to this conclusion than any other theory I have read (and I have read a lot). I also believe this is why we didn't really get any GEQ lore in the DLC, because there is plenty of evidence in the base game. I would be very happy to be proven wrong and to hear a better theory. \n\n\n\n**Who is the Gloam Eyed Queen (The Queen in Black)?**  \nMarika, and by extension, Melina, who is an offshoot/daughter/reincarnation of Marika.\n\n**When on the timeline did the \"God Hunt\" occur?**   \nShortly before Marika became \"Marika the Eternal\".\n\n**What God/s was hunted?**  \nThe Fell God, spread across the Trolls. The Trolls were skinned and the Fell God was cut out of the Trolls abdomen and replaced with a tablet, which likely contains magical properties that can ward off the Fell Gods influence. The trolls that are not skinned are those who originally betrayed the Fell God and the Fire Giants, and joined Marika and Godfrey's forces during the war. Now they remain as guards to the Forge of the Giants.\n\n**Why did she do this?**  \nOn top of the fact that they were a huge threat to her in general, it is stated that the Fell God also \"*haunts the sagas of the Hornsent*\". We know that Marika had some kind of alliance with the Hornsent, likely because she needed access to the Gate of Divinity. What better way to gain their trust than defeating an enemy that has haunted them for generations.\n\n**How did she do this?**  \nEven before becoming a God, Marika had already amassed great power and many allies. She was also an Empyrean, meaning she had direct ties to Metyr.\n\n**The elephant in the room, Malekith, and why he would have \"defeated\" her.**  \n*\"Marika's sole need of her shadow was a vessel to lock away Destined Death. Even then, she betrayed him.\".* This explains it all since it's well known that Marika wanted to remove death all together. She planned for Malekith to defeat her and seal away Destined Death once she had finished using it's power. She used him, and that is how she betray him.\n\n\n\n**My reasoning and \"evidence\" (I'll try to organise it):**\n\n* The Godskin weapons are large, and that is even made clear in their item description. This likely means that they were used for skinning large creatures, such as the Trolls.\n* The Godskins have \"assimilated\" inhuman physiology, similar to that of the crucible. Assimilate is an interesting word to have been used, meaning that they took in these traits from somewhere. The Furnace Visage depicts the Fell God surrounded in horns, directly linking it to the crucible.\n* Trolls, which are descended from Giants, all have the front of their abdomens carved out. This is the same location where the Fell God sits on the Fire Giant we face. All the trolls, except for those found in the mountain tops, appear to be flayed. The natural skin colour of the Trolls also appears to be white, matching that of the Godskins attire.\n* The Noble Presence incantation mirrors that of the roar of the Trolls and the eruption attack move during the 2nd phase of the Fire Giant. It's description states: \"*Once a sign of the gods' wrath, this incantation became a trophy\u00a0of the Nobles' god hunt.*\"\n* The Godskins Noble Robe has 7 faces in a circle with a sigil at the bottom that looks an awful lot like Metyr, and another symbol in the center. This pattern is the same as the Fell Gods Eye, eight circles surrounding a center circle.\n* The Trolls have golden/yellow eyes, the same as the faces on the Godskin Noble Robes. The Trolls face even share a similar all-round tentacle like feature to these faces.\n* The Furnace Visage is said to depict the Fell God, but the Fell God typically has only one eye. This makes sense though if the Furnace Visage is actually depicting the face of a Troll, which is similar in design.\n* The Godslayer's Seal and the sigil for Black Flame Incantations look a lot like Metyrs head.\n* Blackflame Monk Amon is said to have fled from the Giants Flame when he swore fealty to the Black Flame. Why turn to the Black Flame? Why make this connection between the Fell God/Fire Monks and the Black Flame/GEQ?\n* It is specifically stated that the Fell God was said to have been slain by Marika.\n* The cave where we find the Godskin Swaddling Cloth is right near where the Battle against the Giants took place, and the First Church of Marika.\n* It is stated that the Age of the Erdtree began right after the war against the giants when the Trolls betrayed and fire was vanquished. It makes sense that this happened, Marika gained the trust of the Hornsent and got access to the Gate of Divinity, allowing her to become a God, Marika the Eternal.\n* The frenzied trolls in the snowfields are likely Trolls who managed to escape or were set loose because they were afflicted by frenzy due to the trauma they went through.\n* The trolls with Fur in the mountain tops have fur and guard the forge because they are the Trolls that betray the giants and joined with Marika. People say that they have fur \"because it's cold\". I know it's a game, but evolution doesn't just happen like that, and the other trolls are very clearly skinned/flayed and are not just simply missing their fur.\n* There are only 2-3 trolls in the Shadow of the Erdtree, likely because Marika removed them as part of her plan to gain the trust of the Hornsent.\n* How could Marika have gotten away with all this? Marika is already known to have rewritten the history books and hide her own past. People in the Lands Between know these events happened, but her name has just been removed and replaced with the Gloam Eyed Queen.\n* Rykard speaks \"blasphemy\", likely about Marika's past. There are a lot of dead trolls on the Road to Iniquity that have likely been tortured and interrogated for information, but there is a single Frenzied Troll right outside Volcano Manor. I would guess that this Troll was tortured and revealed the truth about Marika to Rykard and his Inquisitors before succumbing to frenzy and going mad.\n\n\n\nHope you enjoyed",

Given the gates proximity to Rauh I don't think it's a stretch to connect the Gate of Divinity to something that predates ER's known history. Sure the Hornsent built a structure to the Gate but I don't know that means the gate wasn't there before the Hornsent and I'm not sure it matters for the discussion since this is more about themes.

An extreme magical contraception method? Trying to escape the fate like ranni did? \n\nAlso the jarring ritual for me evokes again a theme of forced pregnancy: the imagery itself with women suffering with body horror and other parts that attack you with a pseudo umbilical cord. It makes me think the shaman people- who i think are only women, are the \u201cvehicle\u201d, the vessel, the glue of rebirth. These women have to literally carry and transform souls into \u201csaints\u201d by carrying their fleshy transformation - its a very fucked up allegory to saintly reincarnation but from the perspective of the mothers.\n\nI think marika is naturally a good vessel that could not only make saints but gods too, and so she became the vessel of the elden ring- a God but we know that godhood is a prison and she was now cursed by fate to practically rebirth the gods into her children. \n\nI see this theme in most empyreans we know, Ranni did the ultimate contraception and Malenia is cursed being a vessel of a \u201cmothering\u201d god and a candidate for replacing marika, she even is referred as an unwilling mother who doesnt accept her children (kindred of rot). Miquela is weird and his nascency curse is maybe what stops him from being able to be a literal full grown \u201cmother\u201d empyrean. \n\n\nTldr: i think marika is a life/fertility goddess who really really doesnt want to.",

It\u2019s just the way things went. Truthfully, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s who I am at all.\n\nIf I\u2019m being honest, what I really think; I\u2019m nobody. I\u2019m nothing. I don\u2019t have much family, and all of my friends have their own.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019ve ever done of any value in this life is bring people entertainment with my clips and my lore posts. \n\nSo maybe who I am is the Limgrave Butcher, and what I do is entertain the people who love these games just as much as I do.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be. Just a blip. \n\nI often daydream about a reality where I\u2019m somebody more than what I really am. A reality in which I\u2019m not just bringing a smile to dozens of people\u2019s faces; but to everyone on this planet who needs one. But I know I\u2019ll never live up it.\n\nSo thank you, for enjoying my posts. Even the ones where I\u2019m being silly. You may be the only meaning my life will ever have.\n\nIn my introspection I wonder, is that the point of these games? To be somebody more than what you could ever dream to be.\n\nElden Ring isn\u2019t a great video game because it\u2019s open world Dark Souls, or because it has excellent bosses. It\u2019s a great game because you are looking into a mirror.\n\nNot only does the story of Elden Ring reflect the history of our own world. It lets you choose how you would rule the world.\n\nBut for you to understand the choice you are making, you have to understand the default ending. \n\nIt\u2019s not super complicated, you mend the Elden Ring as close as you can to imitate the Golden Order. You won\u2019t ever live up to the Golden Order, but\u2026 well, you\u2019ve all played Dark Souls. It\u2019s merely a cycle.\n\nBut what does mending the Elden Ring in a default state mean? Well, look at the world around you. \n\nThe Golden Order was an undoubtedly a critique of the rise and the worldwide domination of Christian Capatalism. It is a critique of Amarika. And it\u2019s also a warning. \n\nThe Original Sin of Marika isn\u2019t so far off from Eves Original Sin.\n\nMetyr is the serpent that seduced Eve into usurping God. Once a child of God, she was abandoned, and so she became vengeful. \n\nThe Golden Order subjugates the Pagans through violence, they even use their own symbolism against them. They believe in one true god, they believe they are above the natural law. Marika is Crucified similarly to Jesus Christ.\n\nMarika has monopolized life and death. She created the Erdtree so that she could control who lived and who died based on how useful to the system they were. People could only have true death if they were accepted into the system. Kinda sounds like Heaven and Hell. \n\nBut it all backfired on her. The Omens arent just Hornsent descendants. They are the new, cursed Hornsent. A brutish reminder of the Crucible. The natural world fights back.\n\nAnd the most devastating blow to Marika, Godwyn. \n\nThe game states that the Shattering happened because of Godwyn. The lore community took this as an emotional reaction. I think it\u2019s a reaction of desperation. \n\nMarika didn\u2019t shatter the Elden Ring because she was sad that her son died. Fucking hell, Marika literally says \u201cif you are my son or daugher and you don\u2019t become anything then you will be SACRIFICED.\u201d \n\nMarika shattered the Elden Ring to stop Godwyn from usurping her. Deathblight overwrote Erdtree Burial. She didn\u2019t just lose her son, she lost control. \n\nMarika thought herself above death, she wanted to control it. But death isn\u2019t a belief. Death is life. \n\nRot; and Death may have been suppressed because of the removal of Destined Death, but the concepts didn\u2019t stop existing. They mutated into a twisted version of their natural state when given the chance. \n\nSpeaking of which, Fias ending was one of death restored. Not just Destined Death. But Deathblight as well. In Marikas attempt to weaken death, she made it significantly stronger. \n\nFia is the antichrist of Elden Ring. The one who would bring about the end of the Golden Order on a literal fundamental level. She is NOT bringing the world back to its natural state. \n\nDeathblight and Destined Death have the same source, but they are not the same thing. \n\nDestined Death was life and death controlled by the Greater Wills fate. With Deathblight you are God. You are the life and death within one vessel. You can\u2019t rot, you are no longer bound by the natural state. \n\nIf Deathblight was natural, it wouldn\u2019t be weak to Golden Order Fundamentalism which is a scientific study of the Greater Will.\n\nI believe you could most easily compare The Age of the Duskborn to Satanism. You are still within the order, but you become your own personal Greater Will. It\u2019s a story of self empowerment.\n\nBelieve it or not, the Dungeater is also a twisted part of Order. \n\nThe Age of Despair is the revenge of the Hornsent upon the Golden Order. In this ending you are forcing the entire world to be equally cursed together. Likely symbolic of Communism, we are all in it together equally. \n\nA lot of people view Goldmasks ending to be a continuation of the Golden Order. And to that end, you are both right and wrong. The Golden Order isn\u2019t just a religion, it is a science, it is as political stance!\n\nGoldmask does not abandon the science behind the Golden Order. He abandons the religion behind it. While he is still a Fundamentalist, he loses his faith in Marika and the Gods. Goldmask is an Agnostic Atheist. Order that isn\u2019t dictated\nby faith, but by science. \n\nThe last 2 endings are my favorite and by far the most complex.\n\nRannis Age of Stars is Anarchy. She spent her entire life controlled by Marikas Golden Order. I think in this way many of us can sympathize with her. But her circumstances were not that of a normal person; So she grew up not to hate Golden Order, but Order itself.\n\n\u201cThe certainties of sight, emotion, faith, will all become impossible. As it is now Souls and Order tightly bound, but I would have them at great remove.\u201d \n\nIn Rannis ending, we send the Elden Ring to the Stars. This is symbolic of us losing control over order. While it\u2019s true that Ranni is a love interest, it\u2019s important to see the bigger picture. The community didn\u2019t see this; So they added into the DLC this: \u201cOnze realized that the Procession of the Stars ended in ruin\u201d\n\nProcession: Follow in an orderly fashion. \n\nOrderly Fashion means the Elden Ring.\n\nThe Elden Ring ending up with the stars ends in ruin. Anarchy isn\u2019t really an option at the end of the day.\n\nNightreign shows us this. While the world may burn, Order has merely been abandoned; not destroyed entirely.\n\nThe abandonment of Order would be the Frenzied Flame. This is the nuclear option. You are not changing Order; Nor are the you abandoning it. You are destroying it completely. What is, will become naught. \n\nThis ending wouldn\u2019t even be an option if the world wasn\u2019t in the state it was in. This isn\u2019t just comically evil nihilism. This is cosmic balance. Karma. The consequence of an unfixable fundamental imbalance forced into the system. \n\nGo back and play the Ds3 DLC. We literally are the FF. The old order is desperately clinging onto power, and we are tasked with burning it all away so a new world can be born. \n\nI guess if I had to choose I would pick Goldmasks ending.",

    "body": "I seem to mention Great Coffins in pretty much every post I make here, but rest assured, this isn't earth-shattering. It's just something I wanted to pen down as I was trying to find my way back to Limgrave from Liurnia without my map.\n\n**Addendum 1: The Treespear**\n\nI happened to come across the Great Coffin containing the Treespear in Liurnia, on a now-broken bridge leading from Liurnia into Limgrave, directly outside Stormveil Castle.  There is only one Troll guarding it, somewhat aimlessly, as the path leading to the Great Coffin in littered with the bodies of Cuckoo Footsoldiers and Soldiers.\n\nMost of the paths that we see the Great Coffins take are much shorter than what I've illustrated below, though we don't quite know *where* the journey for Great Coffins start. We do know that this Great Coffin is facing the path leading into Limgrave, as the chest containing the Treespear is facing Liurnia. If one follows where the path may lead, the 'path of least resistance' takes the Great Coffin directly to the Gatefront Ruins, where other Great Coffins, containing the Lordsworn's Greatsword the Flail, currently reside. The Greataxe Great Coffin also ends up at these Ruins, though approaching from the opposite side of the Ruins.\n\n[Proposed Path of the Treespear Great Coffin](https://preview.redd.it/dbnh6h9hne4g1.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=494bac1bcbe0c9015b58aea9cad7f8c293deffd4)\n\nThere are some questions that arise from this:\n\n1. **Who was escorting this Great Coffin?** We know that the other Liurnian Great Coffin containing the Carian Knight's Sword was escorted by the Cuckoos. Furthermore, Great Coffins, traditionally, are pulled by two Trolls; only one Troll, free of his chain, remains in the area. However, a Cuckoo escort would be strange, as this particular Great Coffin contains a Treespear, which we know is a weapon \"wielded by knights employed as palace guards in the Royal Capital of Leyndell\". Cuckoos are traditionally locked in conflict with the Carians and potentially with certain individuals from the Raya Lucarian Academy, but there is seemingly no record of interaction between any Leyndell forces and the Cuckoos. Worth noting as well that there is an Erdtree Sentinel roaming Limgrave, though we have no evidence this Erdtree Sentinel is directly loyal to Godrick either, which brings me to my next point.\n2. **Was there a conflict between the Cuckoos and Stormveil?** Its proximity to Stormveil can't be ignored, but at the same time, there is no evidence that the Exiles or Banished Knights were responsible for the slaughter of the Cuckoos. If anything, it almost looks like the Troll may have been responsible by virtue of being the only one alive at the scene. \n3. **When was the bridge destroyed?** It seems odd that the Great Coffin was going down a path that obviously leads off a cliff. If we were to assume this bridge was destroyed in the Shattering, would it not be known if a major highway were destroyed? If we assume that its destruction was more recent, would it have been related to the seeming massacre of the escort?\n\n  \n**Addendum 2: The Flail**\n\nWhile writing the above, I remembered that the Flail is one of those neutral weapons that seems to have no real lore to it. However, the Flail in that Great Coffin did belong to *someone*, even if that someone is a \"nameless fallen warrior\".\n\nReflecting on the two NPCs who actually wield the Flail, an interesting connection emerged:\n\n1. **Brother Corhyn:** While never directly referenced in his dialogue (that I'm aware of), Corhyn is a Prophet. He not only wears the clothes of the Prophets, which describe \"*exiled prophets who foretold misfortune \u2014 and were persecuted and driven from their homes as a result\"*, but his own unique Robe completes the narrative: \"*Even after exile, Corhyn refused to recant his prophecies.\"* The *\"sinister prophecy\"* in question is elaborated on in the Catch Flame incantation: *\"The flame of ruin is anathema to the Erdtree. But prophets sometimes glimpse it within the faith all the same. Sadly when this occurs their sole reward is banishment.\"*\n2. **Adan, Thief of Fire:** Located in the Malefactor's Evergaol in Liurnia, we don't have a complete view of what his life was like prior to his stealing the Flame of the Fell God. What we do know is that the Flame of the Fell God was located in the Guardians' Garrison in the Mountaintops of the Giants. It is possible, given that Adan is a Human NPC that he was once a Flame Guardian, as the Flame Guardians are only really found on the inside of the Garrison on the way to Chief Guardian Arganthy, who was protecting the incantation. However, while Adan literally stole an incantation*,* what exactly he stole may also be interpreted another way. The One-Eyed Shield explains that the *\"malformed one-eyed god\"* was \"o*nce worshipped by the giants\"*, and that *\"this evil deity is believed to have been slain by Queen Marika.*\" However, the existence of the Flame of the Fell God incantation was possibly being protected because its existence proved that \"*the fell god still lurks within the Fire Giants\".* It is unclear who locked Adan in the Evergaol, but we do know Adan was being chased by the Fire Monks from the Mountaintops, through Altus Plateau, all the way to the southwest of Liurnia.\n\nWe veer heavily into **theory** from this point on. While I find it more likely that Adan was a Flame Guardian because of the Flame Guardians being Human NPCs and having easy access to the area where the Flame of the Fell God was stored, there is also the possibility that Adan, like Corhyn, was a Prophet. If so, his visions of the \"flame of ruin\" may be what compelled him to steal the Flame of the Fell God in the first place. His mixed outfit comprising a Fire Monk's Hood and altered Fire Prelate armor may suggest he stole what he could when he ran from the Garrison to protect himself. As far as why he's locked in an Evergaol, perhaps that was an act of self-imprisonment. Maybe that was Adan's idea of preventing his visions of the flame of ruin from ever coming to pass.\n\nThis does nothing to answer *why* Prophets use Flails, but it is interesting that two people tangentially linked to the Cardinal Sin have this one thing in common. It begs the question of whether or not a Prophet of some renown who died in Limgrave was inside of that Great Coffin.",

    "body": "This is the third of a series of posts where I delve into the the narrative of Elden ring as an introspective journey Marika undergoes externally through the journeys of the mending rune bearing tarnished after her disillusionment with the order and her grief in relation to the death of Godwyn's soul.\n\nFia as a mother to Godwyn, opressed life giver and ritualistic prostitute.\n\nGoldmask as a sage and soul seeker in the depth of the golden order.\n\nDung eater as the manifestation of the hornsent's foul legacy and the karmic dept or sin that was born of what they did to her and what she did to them.\n\nThis is going to be THE longest post of the three as even though Dung eater as a character appears to be the least interesting of the bunch and his questline is best described as deranged and his mending rune as morally abhorrent. His existence or rather what he represents is a surrender to generational hatred and an embrace of original sin itself.\n\nThe sun realm :\n\nThe sun realm is precisely mentioned in ONE item description on a random chance drop shield but it's existence is hinted at constantly and consistently through most of the lands between.\n\nBefore the DLC all we had were a bunch of inconsistent and quite frankly worthless information about a bunch of skeletons and wraiths. But with the robust portrayal of the hornsent we can confidently confirm that : the sun realm did exist, it did dominate the lands between, it practiced storm and divine beast veneration as aspects of the crucible and partook in dragon communion, stuborn clinging to life, it's main fighting force were the banished knights led by commanders Niall and O'Niel (meaning son of Niel or Niall btw) and most importantly it honored death. The sun realm is not necessarily the hornsent but they are it's ideological and cultural center, not all of them need to bear horns.\n\nThe most ancient elden lord we find in the story of the lands between is Placidussax who lies in the storm beyond time at the heart of Farum Azula and the beasts that serve him. Now their wildness and vitality drained away in exchange for the fingers and intelligence granted upon them (descriptions of the cinquedea and beastial vitality). The hornsent worship this storm and venerate it and the beasts who dwell in it and their movements as the most ancient signifier of divinity and primacy. The banished knights, who use these storm innovations, partake in dragon communion to honor the ancient dragons, have dragons on their helmets and were given the choice of either banishment or servitude to Godfrey after his defeat of the lord of stormveil. The ones that accepted still render service to the golden lineage to this day in stormveil serving Godrick, the ones that refused either prowl Farum Azula, or the mountaintops and Caelid as ghosts let by their commanders. In nightreign, the banished knights in the castle even kneel to the horned colosseum lion in front of the gate. The banished knight armor and weaponry even litters practically every major non Carian fort in the lands between. Architectural clues are also very useful here, as Castle Sol is named after the sun, the eclipe imagery is also very clear adding to the sun connotations. Castle morne is also under control of the golden lineage as Castellan Edgar is there under orders of Godrick. \n\nThe sword of castle morne is also a massive hint linking the banished knights, stormveil, the sun realm and the death birds. As the model for the sword without the other blades grafted on top is similar to the death ritual spear and feather branch talisman, not just in design but also in spirit. The spear is the weapon of those accepted by the death birds to strengthen them but also a symbol of the promise of the death birds to repay that companionship with resurrection in the far future. The sword strengthens the user through channeling the spirits of the fallen clan still laying in the grafted blade in promise of vengeance. Stormveil castle also has some fascinating architectural clues as the two towers that look like they have a bite taken out of them near where you find the claw talisman bear a striking resemblance to the divine gate of Enir Illim. The claw talisman also depicts assassins who mimic the deathbirds.\n\nBut the most fascinating clues, are found not found there, they're in the shadow keep. As the shadow keep while not containing any banished knight equipment, holds a mass grave of knights where you fight commander Gaius. The architecture of the shadow keep is also not consistent, meaning some parts were probably built later as older parts more used as civillian ground became abandoned. The most damning part about the shadow keep being older than the war was the boats used to burn the soldier's golden ashes that are one to one the same boats the tibia mariners sail and use to guide the spirits lost in death. The helphen steeple also bears a striking resemblance to the steeples seen in the flooded part of the shadow keep, which should be an older part of the keep, called the church district.\n\nAncient Mesopotamia, again :\n\nEnir Illim, based on Bab-Ellim or Babylon is very clearly meant to reference the tower of Babylon meant to stretch to the heavens and reach God.\n\nIn Mesopotamia, one of the main partners of trade and relations was Dilmun. Dilmun was so important it was part of the Mesopotamian creation mythos as a paradise where there is no disease, predators eat no predators, pain is absent and people do not get old. As such it has several recently unearthed mass burial sites. This mythical land was ruled by the benevolent god Inzak, Anzak, Enzak or as he was known in the initial publications and research... Enshag. Making an interesting tie to the supposed lord of the lost and the desperate whose golden bones still cling to life even after all these years worn as armor by Gideon's lackey who's obsessed with getting the medallion leading to castle sol, Ensha. Clinging to life being necessary to provide a death worth offering to the death birds is a theme that ties Ensha to the death birds, tying all this giant mess into a semi coherent society with a center of culture and different regional practices befitting an empire spanning the whole of the lands between. The gate of divinity being the culmination of generations of spirituality and development into the harvesting of death as a way to create life. Life rises from death as it does from life, and from life through death, one gains power as stated by the remembrance of the regal ancestor. The great hammer given from this remembrance's horns are described as wings to reap the lives of the hornless. The horns of an ancestor spirit continue to bud like antlers as life that experiences no sprouting is offered to it through death creating tangled horns, to the hornsent their proof to be a chosen people. And winged creatures are said to be the envoys of death in ancient pagan faith as said by the winged scythe. The gate of divinity can be therefore assumed to be an attempt at creating the ultimate regal ancestor spirit, a true divine beast, that will reap the life of the hornless, melded harmoniously through shaman women flesh and deliver the hornsent to greater heights. A tradition carried on by Godrick through grafting the dead onto his shaman flesh that harmoniously blends with all others. The spiralhorn shield is therefore one of the earliest depictions and an abservation of the spiral current of the crucible by the primal people of Siofra, the ansestor followers funny enough are still found barely clinging in the lake of rot which poisons the ainsel river and both are massive and ancient burial grounds where corpses are thrown in stone coffins. The old man with the tablet, elden John as some call him in the communtiy, is a representative of the hornsent's ancient people's ancient people studied through the ruins of Rauh. And in his hands he holds a one to one replica of an artifact from Mesopotamia, the imago mundi, or map of the world. Mesopotamia itself means the land between two rivers, in the real world the tigris and euphrates, in elden ring, the ainsel and the siofra. The formless mother, in her infinite kindness to lord Mohg in the sewers, showed him his cursed blood's glorious past leading to his righteous desire to revive it, making him retreat to the ruins underground to learn of his lineage. Elden John has been discussed to death in the communtiy and has been found all over the place, Uld ruins, Rauh ruins, the ancient giant coffins and Enir Ellim. Giving the sun realm much deeper roots than belurat and the tower.\n\nHorah Loux - Serosh / Enkidu - Gilgamesh\n\nBut Mesopotamian mythos and it's connection to Elden ring doesn't end here. Gilgamesh was a prideful despot that the god Enki tried to teach a lesson to in humility to the gods. Enki creates a son then named Enkidu, son of Enki. Enkidu lives as one among beasts like horah loux until he is seduced and screwed into submission by a priestess of ishtar named Shamhat for 7 days and nights straight leading to the depletion of his exess in wildness and his civilization by her hand. Enkidu is then apalled when hearing about Gilgamesh and his actions and goes on to fight him to the death. From that fight is born a deep respect between both of them and Gilgamesh's pride is doubled. He then decides to cement his greatness by slaying the divine beast Humbaba that lives in a forest of giant trees after forging axes to do the deed. Humbaba is killed after Enkidu offers guidance and courage to Gilgamesh but now Enkidu's life is forfait as the gods punish him for the death of Humbaba. Gilgamesh learns beyond grief, and absolutely paralyzing fear of death and goes to the underworld to find a way to gain immortality. He gets in the form of a magical fish, he leaves the underworld and as he celebrates in a bath, his fish is eaten, by a serpent, the serpent then becomes immortal and keeps shedding it's skin every time Gilgamesh tries to kill it or in elden ring terms a serpent never dies. After more depression and monologue, dialogue... Gilgamesh decides to learn humility and instead be immortalised in his deeds through the smiles of his people and the stories they tell about him.\n\nThe hatred of the erdtree towards the serpent from the days of Godfrey here can be understood not only from the biblical sens but also Mesopotamian sens of usurpation of immortality from the king. Besides it's connotations and relations to the fell god, but that needs a whole discertation on its own.\n\nThe whole moral of the story is the acceptance of death by a man and a people that tenaciously and pridefully cling to life.\n\nThe culture of the hornsent while having tones of respect for the elders, the dead and valuing life had their culture slowly turn into a cesspool of hatred, fear of death and denial of their atrocities as specified by the caterpillar mask but also denial of the truth as they imprisoned the lamenter.\n\nTheir curse to turn into flies is fitting divine punishment and proof that the hornsent deeply lacked empathy as the people who cared for the sick never became ill. The mother of flies is excellent at offering punishment and she seems quite fond of showing herself to the horned like the bloodfiends who saw a twisted deity in the visage of their tutelary deity.\n\nThere's even a multitude of theories saying the ritual to ascend to godhood requires death of the lord with good proof as Miquella reproduces this without flaw. So then as the golden prince and a lordling, Godwyn's death would have been necessary for him to ascend as lord of Ranni. His mending rune even evokes a black sun, but Marika's plans to put forth Godwyn as her candidate for lordship in the war she planned ever since she banished Godfrey broke. And through his incomplete death, Godwyn became first of the undead and ruler of those who live in death. A continuation of the sun realm tradition, his resurrection was even planned through a failed eclipse. Mohg even respects this tradition yet challenging Godwyn's ancestral claim by declaring his dynasty the Mohgwyn dynasty. Ansbach, a pureblood knight of Mohg is educated enough in these people's customs that he is able to decipher the rite of ascension to Godhood.\n\nThe hornsent are a very prideful, rotten people who's spirits cling to their descendants and whose ancestors persisting as tutelary deities is an honor. Taylew, a golem that was small, weak and the first one to stop functioning was honored through death into becoming the guardian deity of smithing. Meaning there is genuine power and true honor in being first of the dead, a theme in Miyazaki's older works as well.\n\nThe omen curse : \n\nThe curse of the omen manifests in tangled horns all over the body, a very distinct muscular and monstrous frame and nightmares. Golden black fire like the scadutree is seen attacks by omen with royal blood who still have their horns intact. The hornsent don't exhibit these traits.\n\nMarika was so afraid of the curses of the hornsent that she directed Messmer to be the bearer of this curse in her stead. But as his kindling states, that hatred would not be confined. He even curses her himself for his last words.\n\nIn the dlc one of the first ghosts you see speaks to his dead fellows telling them to keep clinging to their hatred so he can fashion curses from it. The grandam has acess to a wraith spell manifesting rancor, the horned bairn item is similar to the omen bairn in function, the hornsent NPC is eaten alive by his desire for vengeance, the revenger of castle morne clings to the souls of his clan through their blades to grant him strength, Ensha refuses to give up on life, the red and blue branch talismans... there's so many examples of hornsent and sun realm clinging to life beyond death and showing rancor as the result. The hornsent are extremely adept at cursing people, at least that's the conclusion I arrived at.\n\nThe omen curse is not the aspects of the crucible randomly being propped into existence. It's the conclusion of an active effort of a dead people to curse the souls of the people of the erdtree. Through their very bloodlines. The curse, when unleashed by Morgott calls forth a spiral of tarnished, dull red gold that causes a rainstorm to occur. Similar to the divine invocation. Mohg through his acceptance of the formless mother and his cursed blood, is able to channel his plight into wings echoing the very first divine warriors who learned from the birds. To note, the deathbirds, not the death rite birds, have shriveled wings that have a brownish color that fades into a dull yellow and then gray. The twin bird is depicted as both red and blue.\n\nThe dung eater : finally.\n\nThe dung eater when viewed through this context is a manifestation of hatred and the weight that causality holds in the world of elden ring. His armor, exised horns with a large pendant depicting the sun, evokes a desire to embody the very concept of hatred of the golden order and the annihilation of the hornsent at their hands. His barbarity isn't random, he says so himself, that he has to defile every corpse with care, it's ritualistic. His screams even call forth the wraiths similar to the omen and hornsent, a blessing and guidance from his ancestors. He doesn't just want to do it. He feel he has to do it to honor his ansestors restless spirits demanding vengeance, it's a duty.\n\nThe dung eater is a tarnished, not an omen. He is a descendant of a warrior of Godfrey making his link to the sun realm by bloodline quite probable.\n\nA seedbed refers to the genital area of males, more specifically the testes and can be used as euphemism for the general area of the crotch. Dung eater's victims all apear to be exclusively male, with a bloody crotch. So when he says he's cursing your bloodline, he's doing it literally, straight from the source.\n\nHis realisation that he needs to be the recepient of his blessing is a repetition or parody of the jarring of the shamans as instead of self reflection upon the evil act he fully accepts it and even goes through it to ensure his vengeance.\n\nA surrender to hate and cycles of violence and curses, dead in a sewer, after a lifetime of misery inflicted upon others and himself. A grand and brilliant fate to such a storied and deeply rooted civilisation. The karmic dept of the world becoming so deeply entrenched, Marika alone can't bear it, everyone has to bear it's consequence as there is no way to sever causality and the first sin will follow all. Marika through this refuses to let go of the past and embraces letting all the world share in the curses flung at her.\n\nFeel free to give feedback.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "# Overview\n\nHere's what we know of the Carian Knights in general:\n\n* The Carian Knights (also referred to as \"Enchanted Knights\") were anointed by the Lunar Queen\n* They were all heroes of the highest honors, but fell into disarray with the decline of the royal family\n* They served as direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses\n* They were awarded the Carian Filigreed Crest, which is described as an \"honor\", reducing the burden of casting sorceries\n* They were gifted the Carian Glintblade Staff, rather than the Carian Glintstone Staff (which would enable Sorcerers to take on the role of an enchanted knight, likely in lieu of being able to wield both sorceries and swords)\n* They had sorceries bestowed upon them by the Carian Royal family. \"Human\" Carian Knights, for example, combined the Glintblade Phalanx with their swordsmanship to maintain pressure upon their foes, striking in waves of steel and sorcery.\n* Enchanted troll knights were \"the comrades of the young Rennala, bound by oath.\"\n* The Carian Knights are said to \"never waver\", with the \"Human\" Carian Knights leveraging the Lucidity sorcery to alleviate any onset of Sleep and Madness\n* The \"Human\" Carian Knights carried a shield said to excel when facing both magic or holy attacks, which points to enemies from both Liurnia (anticipating betrayal from the Academy, referenced in the \"Carian Retaliation\" sorcery) and Leyndell (Erdtree Sentinels, rather than Dragon Cultists, perhaps?)\n* These knights' swords could serve as catalysts, letting them wield sorcerous battle skills\n* They formerly used the Carian Sorcery Sword (said to be used by \"the Carian knights of old\") before the full refinement of their sorcerous combat techniques, as it functioned as a catalyst for glintstone sorcery when executing strong attacks. Note that the Weapon Skill for this sword is \"Impaling Thrust\", same as the \"Spear\" that was once used by the Enchanted Knight class in V1.00, though back then, that was known as the \"Winged Spear\" and used \"Charge Forth\" as the base weapon skill.\n* Despite numbering fewer than twenty, this power to wield sorcerous battle skills made them a match for even the champions of gold in battle\n* **Adding this point regarding Troll Knights because I forgot to when I first posted:** *Called into service when the Queen invoked an oath they swore,* *the trolls are treated as true knights of Caria, and fight arm in arm with their human comrades.*\n\nWhile we obviously can never really say whether it was a rule to only have fewer than twenty Carian Knights at any given time, as a broad statement, it begs the question: **how many can we realistically account for?**\n\n# \"Human\" Carian Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #1: Loretta**\n\n* **Quote:** \"Loretta was once a royal Carian Knight and her lapis-lazuli blue cape is the emblem of the knightly pride that continues to guide her\"\n* **Quote:** Undertook a \"long, bloody journey to seek out a place where the Albinaurics could live in peace\" and \"determined that the Haligtree was their best chance for eventual salvation.\"\n* **Quote:** \"It is said that the bow was Loretta's favored weapon.\"\n* **Quote:** Her war sickle is said to have originally \"been given for service as a personal guard to Carian royalty\"\n* **Observation:** She is now a Knight of the Haligtree, loyal to Miquella, with her war sickle's blue glintstone now replaced by unalloyed gold\n* **Observation:** Rumored to be an Albinauric, though the game's text decries this rumor as \"absurd\"\n\n**Carian Knight #2: Moongrum**\n\n* **Observation:** Guards the entrance of the elevator leading up to Rennala at the Raya Lucarian Academy\n* **Observation:** Wields a Carian Knight's Shield (with Carian Retaliation), a Carian Knight's Sword, uses an Academy Glintstone Staff to cast Carian Piercer.\n* **Observation:** The Carian Piercer is a counterpart to the Carian Greatsword sorcery, which itself is said to allow sorcerers to \"gain the strength of knights, their loyalty sworn to the moon.\"\n* **Theory:** While some theorize that Moongrum turned on Rellana and sided with the Academy, the Academy itself seems to be splintered and lacks leadership. My personal belief is that Moongrum is still loyal to Rennala and is found where he is because he's protecting her. His mostly Carian loadout is only contradicted by his choice of staff, which itself is still using a Carian sorcery; it's not a massive leap to guess that he entered the ranks of the Carian Knights when the Carian Royals and the Raya Lucarian Academy were allied.\n\n**Carian Knight #3: Moonrithyll**\n\n* **Observation:** Found at Castle Ensis, guarding the path ultimately leading to Rellana, Twin Moon Knight, Rellana's younger sister, and former Carian Princess\n* **Observation:** Described as \"steadfast\", Moonrithyll was the \"Twin Moon Knight's chamberlain\"\n* **Quote:** \"She was also a friend to the trolls, who served the royal family, and proudly wielded their weapons as she fought arm in arm with her gargantuan comrades\"\n* **Observation:** Rellana's Cameo, found at the altar directly behind where Moonrithyll is fought, speaks of an \"unparalleled devotion of those who left their homelands to serve Rellana.\"\n* **Quote:** The following quote, included in the description of the Cameo, may be attributed to her, given its proximity to where she was found: *'By your leave, we will accompany you wherever your lunar vessel takes you.'*\n* **Theory:** Physically, she appears to be a genderbent version of Moongrum; their common name structure and respective protection of siblings of Carian royalty (former or otherwise) reinforces the notion that, even if they aren't twins, they may at the very least be siblings or related in some way\n\n**Carian Knight #4: Carian Manor Spirit**\n\n* **Observation:** As the name suggests, this Carian Knight is found at Caria Manor, though they are already deceased\n* **Observation:** When spoken to, their dialogue indicates that their loyalty is specifically to Ranni: \"Lady Ranni, we have long awaited you. I pray for your house's swift arrival. May the full moon shine upon Caria.\"\n* **Observation:** While I cannot directly confirm this myself, this [face guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3275057381) suggests that Moongrum's model is reused here; there's no canon reason to believe this is Moongrum's twin brother, but I won't stop you from speculating\n* **Observation:** It is important to me, for the sake of Carian Knight #17, that this reinforces that Carian Knights were \"direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses\", of which Ranni once was (**EDIT:** This is poorly phrased -- what I'm getting at here is that this Carian Knight seems to not just be a direct retainer to the Carian princesses in general, but possibly specifically to Ranni)\n\n# Carian Troll Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #5: Bols**\n\n* **Observation:** Locked inside the Cuckoo's Evergaol, clearly implying that it was the Knights of the Cuckoo who imprisoned him there, and that he defended Caria when the Academy split from Caria in the aftermath of Radagon's departure\n* **Observation:** Wields the Troll Knight's Sword, specifically with the ability to cast Greatblade Phalanx\n* **Observation:** Drops Greatblade Phalanx when killed, which is said to be used by the enchanted troll knights\n\n**Carian Knight #6: Troll Knight in Caria Manor**\n\n* **Observation:** Effectively the same moveset as Bols (**EDIT:** Just assume this is true for all Troll Knights)\n* **Theory:** By virtue of where this Troll Knight is found, this Troll Knight is still loyal to the Carian Royalty, and is one of the few Troll Knights that are still living\n\n**Carian Knight #7: Troll Knight outside Converted Fringe Tower**\n\n* **Theory:** One can assume, given the role of Carian Knight #6, that this Troll Knight was loyal to the sorcerer controlling the Converted Fringe Tower. It is unlikely this sorcerer was a Carian princess, so it leaves a question as to why the enchanted troll knight here, still clad in Carian armor and wielding Carian weaponry, pledged their loyalty to a sorcerer. However, this would not be the only example of this kind of questionable allegiance, especially because we know that they fell into disarray with the decline of the royal family.\n* **Observation:** This tower in East Liurnia contains Haima sorceries and requires those who enter to be in possession of a Glinstone crown, to know the Erudition gesture, and to perform it in front of the statue of Marika; there is another Converted Tower in West Liurnia with a similar requirement.\n* **Theory:** As this is not a Sorcerer's Rise, and a statue of Marika is found in it, and one must display their \"Erudition\" (or in other terms, their \"Intelligence\") in front of the literal embodiment of \"Faith\", maybe there's something suggesting that these towers were \"converted\" from outposts that once belonged to Erdtree forces to Carian/Academy Towers.\n* **Theory:** Whoever controlled this tower, if it was not Haima themselves (as they were the adjudicator of the Academy), belonged to Haima's conspectus. Given that a Graven School is found here, this particular sorcerer may have some strong ties to the Primeval Current, or at the very least Sellen and Azur. There is definitely some lore worth reconciling.\n\n**Carian Knight #8: Troll Knight in Castle Ensis**\n\n* **Observation:** A similar parallel between Moongrum and Moonrithyll, this Troll Knight parallels the Troll Knight found defending Caria Manor\n* **Theory:** This Troll Knight may explicitly have been friends with Moonrithyll, given her camaraderie with the Troll Knights\n* **Theory:** We can assume a similar characterization with Rellana, i.e. they would have also demonstrated the \"unparalleled devotion of those who left their homelands to serve Rellana.\"\n\n**Carian Knight #9: Blue Spectral Troll Knight in Liurnia Highway North**\n\n* **Observation:** Seemingly protects the road leading to the Academy from Raya Lucarian soldiers. May serve the Twinsage sorcerer at the Highway Lookout Tower, who summons a small squadron of Aristocrats and Wandering Noble Sorcerers in front of the tower.\n* **Theory:** It is worth noting that the Twinsage sorcerer's presence may not be dissimilar to how the Converted Towers were taken over, though in this particular instance, the Twinsage sorcerer took this tower from the Raya Lucarian soldiers...which, seems odd if you consider that they're both supposed to be aligned with the Academy against Caria. The game does allude to the Cuckoo Knights' \"refusal to be mere servants of the academy\", so perhaps these are the embers of a war between Raya Lucaria and the Cuckoos? If so, it is curious to see a Carian Knight on the side of the Academy against the Cuckoos.\n* **Question:** Sort of a general question I have for people who may understand the concept better than I do: I often see these blue spirits referred to as \"puppets\", but can't find an example of where this is explicitly referenced. Do we know for sure that these are puppets?\n* **Theory:** If the above is true, than this Carian Knight, as well as all the Wandering Noble spirits, is clearly under the control of the Twinsage sorcerer, possibly unwillingly\n* **Observation:** In contradiction to the above, there are two cases that I feel contradict the notion of a 'puppet'. The Rennala projection can an oath-sworn Troll, suggesting that the 'oath' may extend beyond life itself, and can be invoked in a manner similar to spirit ashes, though these spirits are not blue. Fia, on the other hand, summons her champions (through what mechanism, I'm not sure), and they definitely *are* blue, which calls into question whether or not they are puppets, or are similarly oath-sworn.\n\n# Headless Spectral Troll Knights\n\n**Carian Knights #10, #11, #12: Headless Spectral Troll Knights guarding the Four Belfries**\n\n* **Observation:** There are three headless knights here, though only one \"spawns\" in the way that Carian Knight #9 does. The other two are seemingly always there.\n* **Observation:** Curiously, even though this area is known as the \"Four Belfries\" there are only three waygates.\n* **Theory:** There is a connection, though unclear, between these Headless Troll Knights and the Mausoleum Soldiers/Knights guarding the Walking Mausoleums and the Black Knife Catacombs. We know that Mausoleum Knights invoked a \"self-inflicted curse that ties the spirits of these loyal knights to the land, having willingly beheaded themselves so that they may serve their masters in death.\"\n* **Theory:** There is no evidence for this, but one potential theory is that each waygate corresponds to one of the Headless Troll Knights. Perhaps it was the sacrifice of each of these knights that closed off the waygates, and it is through an oath or self-inflicted curse that they continue to protect these waygates as spectral beings. It remains unclear what the Four Belfries have to do with Caria, but their being in Liurnia naturally creates strong ties to begin with. Likewise, hard to know whether these waygates are being protected in the name of Caria.\n* **Question:** Maybe people have elaborated on this in other posts, but the relief of a bearded man in front of the branches fo the Erdtree strikes me as similar to the reliefs of the Haligtree found in throughout the Haligtree itself, e.g. on the tombstones found in the graveyard near the Haligtree Roots. Is this a connection or similarity that I'm imagining?\n\n**Carian Knight #13: Headless Spectral Troll Knight guarding Fifth Belfry outside Castle Ensis**\n\n* Pretty much everything stated about Carian Knights #10, #11, and #12 applies to this Carian Knight. Its proximity to Castle Ensis strongly reinforces the connection between the Four Belfries and Caria.\n\n# Unconfirmed, but likely Carian Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #14: The Great Coffin west of Liurnia of the Lakes**\n\n* **Observation:** This Great Coffin stops at the edge of the lake, directly across from Testu's Rise, and contains a Carian Knight's Sword. It is escorted by a large group of Cuckoo soldiers. The path taken by the Great Coffin is also patrolled by a Cuckoo Knight pacing back and forth repeatedly.\n* **Observation:** Though it is now cut content, we know from a note on Great Coffins that they \"travel the Lands Between, carrying the bodies of nameless fallen warriors.\" It is therefore more than reasonable to assume that this Great Coffin is carrying the body of a fallen Carian Knight, though one seemingly respected by the Cuckoos.\n* **Theory:** Stopping at the edge of the western lakeshore may indicate that this Carian Knight has some sort of connection, either a fondness or a desire to be laid to rest here, or maybe it has more to do with the preferences of the Cuckoos escorting the Great Coffin. It's not terribly clear. However, the fact that it is across from Testu's Rise is interesting, as it again paints a picture of a Carian Knight who, possibly, was loyal to a sorcerer. Moreover, Testu may or may not have had abilities related to necromancy, as the puzzle that needs to be solved in order to enter the Rise raises putrid corpses from the ground.\n\n**Carian Knight #15: The Tombstone in Raya Lucaria graveyard**\n\n* **Observation:** Three Putrid Corpses (either possessed by way of sorcery or by glintstone itself) are seemingly worshipping this tombstone, upon which lays the armor of a Carian Knight.\n* **Theory:** One can infer that the tombstone, and therefore the grave it sits atop, once belonged to a Carian Knight, one who possibly lived and died at a time when Caria and the Academy were still aligned. It is unclear why the Putrid Corpses are drawn to this grave, but one can infer that, even in a state of seeming undeath, they retain enough sense to revere this Carian Knight that they may have known, recognized, or even revered in life.\n\n# Unconfirmed, may or may not have been Carian Knights\n\n# \n\n**Carian Knight #16: Corpse in Highway Lookout Tower**\n\n* **Observation:** This corpse is found directly behind the Twinsage sorcerer at the top of the Highway Lookout Tower, though it may be unlikely that the Twinsage sorcerer killed this individual, as the corpse is smoldering. It is in fact identical to the corpse found in the lower levels of the Roundtable Hold, except that it is holding a rusted rapier, possibly suggesting that it was present at the battle that had occurred at Liurnia Highway North involving the Marionettes and the Flame Chariots.\n* **Observation:** Quite critically, the Carian Glintblade Staff is found on this corpse, which we know were gifted to Enchanted Knights. It is unlikely that this staff would be found in the hands of anyone other than a Carian Knight for this express reason.\n* **Observation:** There is precedent for items relating to a specific character being found on a smoldering corpse implied to have been said character: Lionel's armor can be found on a corpse sitting on a bed directly next to where the Deathbed Dress is found. Lionel is already one of Fia's champions, and declared himself to be her father in life when they met, so it's fairly clear that this smoldering corpse was Lionel.\n* **Theory:** Regarding that battle, I think it may have been separate to the battle that is presently occurring between the Cuckoos and the Twinsage sorcerer's blue spectres. Everything being rusted is one indication, but the other is all the Exile Soldier and Banished Knight weaponry found marking the battlefield; this weaponry is also found inside the tower. Stormveil is within riding distance of this area, so it's possible that this was a battle between Stormveil forces and the Academy.\n* **Theory:** Alternatively, given that the Spirit NPC states that the puppets were besieging \"us\", from the perspective of a Wandering Noble Sorcerer spirit, maybe this was where the Academy first betrayed Caria.\n\n**Carian Knight #17: The Ash of War dropped by the Night's Cavalry in Liurnia**\n\n* **Theory:** By far the weakest and maybe the most unnecessary case for a Carian Knight, but I didn't want to ignore it. I had previously made a post suggesting that the Ashes of War dropped by the Night's Cavalry were once the Weapon Skills of warriors that they had defeated. This Ice Spear is said to be a \"skill of the warriors who served Lunar Princess Ranni.\" It does not explicitly state that this is a Carian Knight, but we do know Carian Knight #4 had clear ties to Ranni. Enchanted Knights, when they were a starting class, once wielded the \"Winged Spear\", which eventually became just the \"Spear\" in the final game. In both the CNT and the final game, this weapon \"can be wielded from behind the safety of a raised shield\", which may reference the Carian Knight's Shield, and is also said to be \"very effective against mounted foes\", which suggests that Carian Knights would have encountered mounted foes in Liurnia. While it's likely this could have been referencing Erdtree Sentinels and later Cuckoo Knights, this Enchanted Knight may have come across and been felled by a Night's Cavalry. Moreover, we know that the Spear is infusable; if we look to Blaidd as a reference to what happens when an oath is sworn, his \"sword was imbued with a cold magic at the moment oath was sworn\", which could have occurred if this Enchanted Knight swore an oath to Ranni, granting them the Ice Spear as a Weapon Skill.",

The goal of this thought experiment is to create your own Age using all the lore in Elden Ring. Though we can debate what canon endings are the best and worse, I want to see what is possible when gameplay restraints are removed. In a sense I want us to go beyond Ranni, Miquella and the Dung Eater tell me what age you would create. \n\nFor example: Let's say our Tarnish likes both the age of perfect order and the age of duskborn. We get ahold.of the elden ring and bring about the Age of the Duskborn but after adding the mending rune we add goldmasks mending rune ensuring the Age of the Duskborn cannot be tampered with. ",

You kill everything, even the healthy plants and animals, with fire or madness, both of which show players and NPCs in more agony than anything else, even rot or acid.\n\nThe best thing you could do would be to work with some priests and mages to use the Rune of Death to kill Godwyn\u2019s body all the way and stop the spread of deathroot. Then put all the runes back into the Elden Ring with Goldmask\u2019s mending rune and let the ring deal with nature. Then create your own set of human laws and policies, like forbidding the mistreatment of misbegotten, albinaurics, demihumans, and omens (and forbidding revenge by those groups), bringing in large numbers of sane people from outside the Lands Between to rebuild, building good relationships with the dragons to burn back the range of the scarlet rot and maintain a firewall against it, forbidding the study of magics that require killing people (making graven masses and grafting), filling the frenzy pit with rocks and sewage, having historians write down all the recently learned information, including how the Greater Will effed off when it was needed the most to discourage blind allegiance to it or any other faction, etc.\n\nThe \u201cgod\u201d is reduced to merely a vessel, no longer in any kind of mental control. If the Greater Will wants to get rid of you and put some other soon to be abandoned Elden Lord in charge, make sure everyone knows how fickle the GW is and that the fingers have been making stuff up for the last 5,000 years. Also keep Ranni in your back pocket to take the ring away if the GW or any other messed up faction tries any such shenanigans.",

    "body": "My theory is that the creatures in the Land of Shadow (specifically those with Horn/Crucible aspects) are suffering from a contamination of Giant remains in their water supply.\n\n\n\nHere is how I\u2019m connecting the dots:\n\n\u2022 Proximity to Water: We see throughout The Land of Shadows that these creatures are usually clustered close to water sources (rivers, lakes, and swamps).\n\n\u2022 The Giant Connection: We know the aspects of the Crucible are said to have \"originated amongst Giants.\" We also know Giants likely participated in boat burials. If they cast their dead downriver, those remains would eventually contaminate the water and the coast.\n\n- if we know that the Aspects Of the CRUSIBLE Sprouted amongst giants, how then did it spread over to humans? \n\n\u2022 \"You Are What You Eat\": We see over and over that creatures in Elden Ring are susceptible to what they consume (Glintstone, Rot, Deathroot). I think the \"Omen\" curse (horns) comes from consuming the remains of the dead.\n\n\u2022 Herbivores vs. Carnivores: Some creatures may have developed horns from a carnivorous diet (eating the dead directly), which might explain why they are haunted by spirits. However, even herbivores in the Land of Shadow sprout horns. This suggests they are getting the curse from the land itself\u2014plants and water infused with these remains.\n\n\u2022 The \"Fell\" Link: It\u2019s interesting that the Omen curse is also referred to as \"The Fell Curse.\" Since the Fell God was worshipped by the Giants, this gives us a direct linguistic link between Omen/Horns and Giants.\n\n\u2022 The Lamenters: This fits perfectly with the Lamenters, who suffer a severe version of the curse. The backs of their heads look disturbingly like a Giant\u2019s face.\n\n\n\nPerhaps this contamination is the way the Giants\u2014or the Fell God\u2014are attempting to return to the Lands Between. \n\n(As we know you cannot TRULLY kill a god, you can trap it but even the god of rot managed to come back from being sealed away eventually, re-emerging as \u201cScarlett Rot\u201d) - unless you have a god slaying weapon I guess  \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to think this, but I\u2019m curious if you guys have insights I overlooked.

        "body": "I have had a similar train of thought on the Hornsent, though, in my opinion, I don't think its specific to the handling of the bodies of giants, or necessarily a product of directly consuming the dead, either. The herbivores of the Rauh Ruins also manifest not just horns, but the unique Spirit Calculuses. Predatory beasts who sit at the top of the hierarchy are the ones who devour other horned beasts, with the accumulation of divine vigor turning them into deific figures. \n\nHornsent culture, and the culture of the realm of shadow at large, center around doing things that typically stand apart as \"unclean.\" Their key practices center around undertaking, butchering, jailing, and execution. All things associated with various lower/outcaste groups in Japan, particularly a group called  'Burakumin' who were an outcaste group in Japanese society. It was composed of people who did certain jobs, and the label was inherited, regardless of what work their offspring (or **their** offspring) did. I think horns, and the cursed blood/filth that they are tied to, are the result of being exposed to death and blood. The Hornsent are kind of like Burakumin, who have taken to embracing the manifestations of their \"impurity\" as signs of divine favor.",
