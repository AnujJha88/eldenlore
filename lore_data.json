    "body": "I\u2019ve been thinking about Morgott and how drastically his appearance changes once you defeat him.\n\nWhen we first encounter him, he looms above us. He looms above us - muscular, and imposing. When we encounter him as Margit he jumps to the ground causing it to quake and leaves a crater behind. Even with most of his body hidden under his robes, you can see he\u2019s physically powerful. \n\nBut after you defeat him, he doesn\u2019t just appear to have been defeated\u2026.he looks completely different. He\u2019s suddenly sporting a much smaller frame. His skin is clinging to bare bones. His omen horns are completely gone, his body is clearly diminished, and even his tail has disappeared. He almost doesn\u2019t look like an Omen anymore. \n\nDoes the lore offer any solid explanation for why he changes so drastically?\nCould this be tied to the loss of his Great Rune\u2026 or is something else entirely going on here? \n\nVaatiVidya\u2019s lore video makes the statement  *\u201cIn death, Morgott\u2019s horns disappear. Perhaps it was final mercy from the Erdtree.\u201d*  We know that Morgott is spurned by the Erdtree and devoid of it\u2019s grace, but could the Erdtree have granted him grace in his final moments? Afterall, Morgott did take up the task of protecting the tree when all others had abandoned the duty.\n\nCould this perhaps be FromSoft\u2019s way of revealing the metaphor at the heart of Morgott\u2019s story\u2026 by stripping away his imposing exterior they allow us to see him for what he truly is\u2026not as The Fell Omen or this intimidating demigod\u2026.but as the unfortunate result of being born far too late into a world that once would have revered him.\n\nIn the words of our Lord and Savior VaatiVidya: *\u201cThe other Demigods all had what Morgott was denied from birth - the Erdtree\u2019s grace, a mother and a fate to call their own. But while Morgott was shackled deep below the Earth they threw it all away, so even though he was born a graceless Omen child Morgott tried to be the Erdtree\u2019s protector. He was never loved and should never have learned love, but nevertheless love the Erdtree, he did.\u201d*\n\nI\u2019m really curious to hear what interpretations or theories others have. FromSoft loves revealing just enough to push players to connect the dots, so I feel like there\u2019s probably something deeper happening here that I\u2019m missing.",

        "body": "Vaati was wrong about that. \n\nMorgott had Grace *before* he is defeated by the Tarnished.  He was denied the love from his mother, family, and the Golden Order initially, so was born a Graceless child (or an \u201cunblessed, forbidden child\u201d in JPN). *But* at some point, he had come to be known as the Grace-Given.  Gideon\u2019s dialogue and the Banished Knight Oleg Ashes\u2019 description call him this, and Morgott\u2019s eyes show evidence of Grace as well.  \n\n(Beings born outside the embrace of Grace retain their own eye color unaffected by the gold light, as seen in Rennala\u2019s, the Tarnished, Hornsent, and the eyes of the Shadowbound Beasts.)\n\nThe Erdtree itself is not a thing with opinion or affection, it\u2019s a tree. A very important and iconic magic tree that represents the Crucible\u2019s power and the Golden Order, but it doesn\u2019t grant Grace or show love to anyone; Grace is attributed to Marika alone. She is the one who created and distributed Grace, and leads the Tarnished with the Guidance of Grace as well.  \u201cGraceless\u201d is someone she either denied from Grace or had removed Grace from; this is what she did to create the Tarnished when sending Godfrey and his fellowship on their long March.  Since Morgott and Mohg were denied by their own mother soon after birth for the presence of their horns, resembling the Hornsent, she declared horned babies Graceless and forbidden in her kingdom. This lead to the subjugation, imprisonment, and often the death of horned children. \u201cOmen\u201d was essentially a kind of slur to instil fear in the families who would have otherwise kept their baby a secret. (In JPN again, they\u2019re called \u201cCursed\u201d and not \u201cOmen\u201d, to be even more direct that they were extremely taboo)\n\nAs for why Morgott or Mohg had Grace later even after being born denied it, I think it runs in the same parallel as the Tarnished; Marika took the Grace from Godfrey and co, and promised to return it to \u201cwage war and brandish the Elden Ring.\u201d  This commandment reminds me of Marika\u2019s words to her own children; to become a Lord, a God, anything but nothing.  Marika created the Tarnished to return to TLB once she had \u201cdied\u201d, unbeknownst to them, so one among them could reach her and the Elden Ring through hardship and  ambition to start a new Age in whatever fashion they desired- this could have also extended to her own children. Though not Tarnished, most of the Demigods had the same feverish Ambition to take the position of Elden Lord and reach the Elden Ring as well. Like the Tarnished, many amassed Runes and became hungry for more power.  Morgott was the closest of anyone to reach that end goal of being the Elden Lord; he just lacked the means to enter the Erdtree.  It\u2019s possible then to assume Morgott was given his Grace when Marika \u201cdied\u201d and Grace called the Tarnished  back to TLB.  Any and all with potential to become Elden Lord may have been granted a chance at obtaining Grace again.\n\nSo there are a few key scenarios that happened after Morgott was banished and grew up in the sewer: Marika shattered the Elden Ring and the shards were claimed by her children, including Morgott.  The strength of the Great Runes tainted the Demigods with madness, spurring the Shattering War. Morgott took it upon himself to take the title of Lord of Leyndell and protector of the Erdtree, defeating all his siblings who had tried to take the throne as well. X/thousand years later a Tarnished arrives and defeats Morgott, whose body changes and horns inexplicably disappear.  \n\nWe know that Omen\u2019s horns don\u2019t just vanish when they die; none do in the sewers and Mohg still has his horns even when his body is used to resurrect Radahn, just not on his head.  It\u2019s been established that Morgott was already Graced prior to his death and his horns didn\u2019t vanish while he was alive, and that horns don\u2019t crumble when an Omen dies either; the last possible outlet of why the horns disappear as he dies very likely lies in his blood.  His decrepit dying/dead corpse has no eyes, but also a very large gouge under his diaphragm- this is also easily seen in the concept art for his dead body.  Morgott recanted his \u201caccursed blood\u201d into his sword hidden in his walking stick. Presumably the sword ceases to exist when he is defeated (Demigod goods are recalled into existence via their Remembrances), and because none of the other Omens, including Mohg, ever extracted their own blood in entirety to concentrate it into something outside their own bodies, this is the only major outlier that sets Morgott apart.  \n\nWhile fighting him in Leyndell, he says something while entering his Phase 2 in the fight: *\u201dThe thrones\u2026 stained by my curse\u2026 such shame I cannot bear. Thy part in this shall not be forgiven.\u201d* He\u2019s talking about his blood. His blood is what is believed to be \u201ccursed\u201d, and what has splattered on the thrones that he has kept intact at the Elden Throne balcony.  He is not just using his sword on the Tarnished either; he uses his blood *constantly* to imbue his sword with its power. He is bled dry by the end of the fight not just from the wounds inflicted by us, but on himself.\n\nBlood being where the \u201cOmen\u201d is also ties back to why Miquella specifically needed Mohg to venture into the Land of Shadow.  Like Morgott as well, Miquella\u2019s leftover corpse is shrivelled and devoid of its own blood, yet used Mohg\u2019s \u201caccursed\u201d blood to travel into the LOS. \n\nBonus ties between Omen and LOS:  what Morgott spits up entering second phase, and the Fell Twins\u2019 (the minibosses leading to the Divine Tower) looks like a liquid \u201cFlame\u201d and is also curiously the same color as the projectile \u201cFlames\u201d produced by the Scadutree Avatar in the Land of Shadow Incantation: *This incantation channels the force of the Scadutree\u2019s power, and its gold is accompanied by shadow.* The Omen are arguably related to Hornsent, and being that the blood is where the physical aspects of their genes are, Omen are the children of those who carried the genetic material of Hornsent while hornless themselves. The Hornsent are just humans, but humans who believed themselves holier and superior to all others for their \u201cblessing\u201d of horns.  Despite whichever culture\u2019s opinion on cursed vs blessed, the horns are a product of blood and an ancient power.  The Bloodfiends were also human once, yet hornless they were trapped in LOS and victim to the Crusade. Blood is power and a gateway.\n\nTL;DR: Morgott bled out from fighting the Tarnished and his blood is where his Omen-ness comes from.  He\u2019s just a withered dehydrated and bloodless man without it.",

Not a misunderstood good, but an evil misunderstood to be good.\n\nHe had good in him, of course, as most villains do: Love for his family. Positive ideals. A willingness to sacrifice himself for others. He likely believed himself to be good as well, as most villains do. With a natural ability to compel others' affections, he likely never got the chance to see the error in his ways.\n\nRegardless of who the blame lies with, his actual goals were still evil, his methods of achieving them were evil, and there is evidence he sometimes did evil and reckless things for no *good* reason at all. Regardless of intent, he is a villain. A complicated one, yes, but not nearly as morally grey as some people present him to be. \n\nThis is basically a huge essay. I tried to shorten it, but couldn't, so feel free to skip around. Also, I skip most of the Mogh/Ansbach stuff, because I think that's pretty obvious. Most of this, especially later on, is from the base game (and sometimes informed by the DLC).\n\n# Age of Brainwashing: \"If you have known sin...\"\n\nSome have often said *\"Miquella had a righteous goal, but the ends no longer justified the means, that's why he's the villain\".*\n\nHis ends weren't good or righteous at all. The Age of Compassion had a shallow positivity that preyed on peoples' desperation in a miserable world, but beneath the surface, it was a clear death of the soul.\n\nWar, hate, and cruelty would be gone. This *is* a good thing. But *all* conflict, disagreement, struggle, and the healthy resolutions that can follow would be gone as well. We see this in Miquella's circle of followers. Their problems are gone because their *identities* are gone. This is not a group of followers - it is a garden, full of Miquella's unalloyed lilies, actual human-shaped vegetables who immediately begin regressing into unresolved trauma, old loyalties, or outright murderous impulses *the moment* that Miquella's charm is broken.\n\nIf you disagreed with me just now, then you've just exercised one of the most fundamental aspects of our lives - the ability to think for yourself. This is what Miquella wished to strip away.\n\nHis age would have been an endless, dream-like haze without free thought, without emotional introspection, and without personal growth. It would be ruled and controlled by a childish god, and enforced by his overwhelmingly powerful warlord Consort, Radahn.\n\nThose charmed by Miquella are 'alive', but they are not truly *living*. Succumb to his charm, and your lifebar fittingly drops to zero, because you are all but *dead.* This is the Age of Compassion ending.\n\nI believe Melina puts it best.\n\n&gt;*\"However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair... Life endures. Births continue. There is beauty in that, is there not? If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion.\"*\n\n\\- Melina, in reference to the *Frenzied Flame*.\n\nMiquella denied this notion, and is frighteningly similar to the Frenzied Flame in how he advertises it.\n\n&gt;*Become their lord.*  \n*Take their torment, despair.*  \n*Their affliction.*  \n*Every sin, every curse.*  \n*And melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos.*\n\n\\- Hyetta\n\n&gt;*Tarnished one. Aspiring Lord of the old order. If you have known sin, if you grieve for this world, then yield the path forward to us.\u00a0 To I, Miquella, and my promised consort, Radahn.*\n\n&gt;*Let your thoughts be only of love.*\n\n\\- Miquella\n\nBoth the Frenzied Flame, and Miquella, wished to melt all individuality into one unvacillating perspective: Their own. Both of them also attempt to convince us, with nearly identical logic, that this is the right thing to do.\n\nBut that was just his end-game. I'm also claiming that this dangerous behavior isn't new to the DLC. Beneath his extremely charismatic persona, his entire life shows subtle, yet egregious signs of manipulation, hypocrisy, zealous extremism, and selfishness.\n\n# Like mother like son: \"Please die a true death.\"\n\nMiquella's motif, among many, is to be a protector and **champion of the meek**. Remember that description.\n\n&gt;*Who is it that Miquella shall bless, if not the low and the meek?*\n\n\\- Sacred Crown Helm\n\nNo group in Elden Ring is described as more meek, persecuted and leaderless than Those Who Live in Death.\n\nEvidence shows Miquella willingly, and knowingly, contributed to their persecution in the Golden Order, and that he continued to refuse them entry into the Haligtree even after leaving it. I believe St. Trina took pity on the dead, however, and this is one of the reasons Miquella felt he had to cast her away.\n\nNow for the evidence.\n\nWe find Revenants and Putrid Corpses in the Haligtree, but neither of these are actually *Those Who Live in Death*, and are more generic examples of 'Undead' that don't fit the criteria of the latter. The distinction is important, and there is plenty of reason to believe *there is* a real distinction in both cases. I believe Miquella made that distinction too. But why?\n\nLooking into Miquella's past for answers, we can piece together who he was, and why this might be:\n\n* He learned Golden Order Fundamentalism and created several incantations for Radagon, such as Discus of Light. Radagon's own attributed incantations were scholarly pursuits \"in all but name\", demonstrating the laws of Causality and Regression.\n* Miquella created Incantations which seemed to display mastery of these two laws - golden discs fly out, and then regress inward. Unlike Radagon's own spells, however, these are *weapons*.\n* Miquella seemingly also created the Pulley Bow and Pulley Crossbow, described as being \"*made by a certain genius who learned Golden Order fundamentalism.\"* Given that Miquella also created Malenia's arm, a robust and mechanically genius *weapon* in its own right, this description fits perfectly\n* Near the Craftsman Shack on Mt. Gelmir, we see one of Miquella's Lilies. This is where we find the Pulley Crossbow. This hints more strongly that Miquella made these, and that his genius was often used to *create weapons.* This is not very characteristic of one who 'blesses the meek'.\n* Miquella also created Radagon's Rings of Light, likely his final creation for the Fundamentalists, as the description states he eventually abandoned Fundamentalism due to its inability to cure Malenia's scarlet rot.\n\nRadagon's Rings of Light is depicted with a gesture, 'Golden Order Totality', given to us by Goldmask after uncovering the secret of Radagon for him. It symbolizes a deeper understanding of Fundamentalism, one that Miquella certainly had.\n\nThe only other Incantation in the game which has Golden Order Totality depicted on it is Litany of Proper Death.\n\n*(I tried embed images here, but failed x\\_x, I will figure it out later)*\n\nA \"Litany\" is a prayer, and a \"Proper\" death could also be called a \"True\" death.\n\nLooking at yet another weapon of Miquella's creation, the Golden Epitaph, we see this:\n\n&gt;*A sword made to commemorate the death of Godwyn the Golden, first of the demigods to die.*\n\n&gt;*Infused with the* ***humble prayer*** *of a young boy; \"O brother, lord brother, please die a* ***true death***.\"\n\nThe Golden Epitaph *was infused* with a *Litany of Proper Death*, quite literally. They both have the ability to permanently kill Those Who Live in Death. The weapon art also grants a version of Sacred Order, another highly effective tool at killing Those Who Live in Death - and it presents the emblem of the Haligtree upon use. This, then, is a tool of the Haligtree.\n\nBut why did he make this?\n\nMiquella certainly cares deeply for his siblings. We see this through his devotion to Malenia. He wants Godwyn to experience a true death, and it's safe to say that he viewed such a death as a mercy. These are arguably healthy things to feel, in his position.\n\nBut we *can't* kill Godwyn with the Epitaph, or seemingly at all. If the Golden Order could have given Godwyn a true death, they would have. Instead, they left him far below the earth, to fester out of sight.\n\nMiquella could have honored Godwyn in any other way. Why does *a weapon designed to permanently kill Those Who Live in Death* serve to honor his brother's death?\n\nMiquella made this weapon, among others, to support the Fundamentalist Hunters and their persecution of Those Who Live in Death. Much like how Marika's sorrow led to her shattering the Elden Ring soon after Godwyn's death, Miquella's own sorrow had warped into vengeance. It was a vengeance against the meek and the lost, because they reminded him of Godwyn's curse, and never once does he extend his gentle hand to them.\n\nYou may be asking yourself, \"Maybe he doesn't hate them, but simply misunderstands them, or just finds them beyond saving?\"\n\nThis underestimates Miquella's genius. Among the many ways you can describe Miquella, he has three definitive characteristics that disprove any claims of ignorance:\n\n1. His genius understanding of Fundamentalism\n2. His overall intellectual curiosity and genius in other pursuits (Haligtree, Unalloyed Gold, Eclipse, advanced craftsmanship of all sorts, etc.)\n3. His empathy, which seems to be *worshiped* by others.\n\nWe know three characters who can fit each of these descriptions in lesser, yet still extremely obvious ways.\n\n1. Goldmask - Fundamentalist Genius, but not on the level of Miquella, at least not at first.\n2. Sorcerer Rogier - Intellectually curious, motivated to learn more about Godwyn's fate, much like Miquella pursuing the 'Eclipse' in Castle Sol.\n3. Deathbed Companion Fia - Purely empathetic, she self-admits to having a poor grasp of 'these grand affairs', and acts instead out of kindness, regardless of how the world views her.\n\n**All three of them reach the** ***same*** **opinion** on Those Who Live in Death.\n\n&gt;*The noble Goldmask lamented what had become of the hunters.\u00a0How easy it is for learning and learnedness to be reduced to the\u00a0ravings of fanatics;* ***all the good and the great wanted, in their\u00a0foolishness, was an absolute evil to contend with.***\n\n&gt;***Does such a notion exist in the fundamentals of Order?***\n\n\\- Order Healing\n\n&gt;*\"Disturb not the Death of Godwyn, the exalted. We, who humbly live in Death...Live in waiting, to one day welcome our Lord. What right does anyone have to object? Our Lord will rise. The Lord of* ***the many, and the meek.****\"*\n\n\\- Fia\n\n&gt;*\"Fascinating, isn't it? That the Golden Order was pliable enough to* ***absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past.*** *With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair, such adaptability is more important now than ever.\"*\n\n&gt;*\"****These souls have committed no offence.*** ***They have every right to life****, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.\"*\n\n\\- Sorcerer Rogier\n\nAll three of them reached this conclusion: Those Who Live in Death were needlessly persecuted, and no such evil exists within the fundamentals of Order. Our character is able to restore Death within Order, after all. As Pastor Miriel says, **\"All things can be conjoined\".**\n\nHeresy is a contrivance. Miriel, Goldmask, Fia, and Rogier all knew it. Miquella definitely knew it, but he didn't seem to care. He did not welcome Those Who Live in Death into any order - whether Golden or Unalloyed - even while knowing that it was completely possible to include them. He wanted them gone, and with them, the living memory of Godwyn's death which - like him - refuse to truly die.\n\nWhich brings us to St. Trina, who seems far more welcoming to the meek.\n\n# \"I abandon here my love.\"\n\nSt. Trina, associated with sleep, the color purple, reprieve, and love, has a list of things associating her with Those Who Live in Death. We find her in a place crawling with Those Who Live in Death, and her Putrescent Knight is - if not literally one of them - then at least visually representative of their kind in a way no other enemy is.\n\nThe similarities between Trina and death:\n\n&gt;*All tainted flesh eventually becomes putrescence, and this clump of it imbibed St. Trina's nectar, which* ***granted it eternal rest***. *And so it was that putrescence became her knight.*\n\n\\- Putrescent Knight Remembrance\n\n&gt;*A pale purple water lily that is on the verge of wilting.\u00a0Material used for crafting items.\u00a0 Exceedingly rare to find.*\u00a0\n\n&gt;*A symbol of faith in St. Trina.*\u00a0***Dulls the senses, preventing agitation.***\n\n\\- Trina's Lily\n\n&gt;*The favor allows one to forget any aches and pains.* ***In Death, there is only peace, for in Death, there can be no sensation.***\n\n\\- Baldachin's Blessing, from Fia, the death**bed** companion.\n\nThe vividly purple waters near Godwyn, the 'fathomless slumber' Rogier describes when succumbing to Death, and Fia's calming presence as a 'deathbed' companion all strike thematic similarities with Trina.\n\nMany have theorized that Trina offered eternal slumber to those who suffered within Marika's order, one where Destined Death was removed. Sleep, then, was an addictive and comforting escape from life, in a world where one could not fully die.\n\n&gt;T*he sweet oblivion of sleep can become quite the habit.*\n\n\\- St. Trina's Arrow\n\nTrina is not likely to be a direct patron of Those Who Live in Death, but her methods of comfort fit perfectly with them; She did not shy away from their kind, even leaving several of her own lilies in places like Summonwater Village (as a fun side-note, because I'm not sure how reliable this is for lore).\n\nMiquella wanted nothing to do with it.\n\n&gt;*\"I abandon here my love\"*\n\nThe love for himself, the love for others, and *the love he refused to acknowledge.*\n\nIt is fair to say, as some have, that the *main* reason he abandoned Trina was to remove the part of himself that could not stand to see Miquella suffer in godhood. This is probably part of it, if not most of it.\n\nBut, if it was *only* to remove the self-love that prevented his ascent to godhood, then why did he *only* hide his abandoned half?\n\nHe did not hide the usage of Mogh's body, or Radahn's soul, despite how controversial it may have been to his followers.\n\nHe did not hide his discarded and precious Empyrean flesh - in fact, he seemingly left individual pieces of it everywhere, on full display. Ranni left her Empyrean flesh atop a tower that most will never climb, but Miquella made it a show at every single golden cross.\n\nIt's as if he was gloating: *\"Here I leave a single follicle of hair, and with it, abandon my rightful inheritance of the Erdtree. Look how much I'm sacrificing, guys.\"*\n\nAs if with bitter irony, however, he abandons Trina in a place filled with coffins and tombs, crawling with Those Who Live in Death, maybe even out of spite for her insistence to care for them. It is the only piece of himself that he hid from others, and he did so out of shame, knowing deep down that he had irreversibly betrayed his promise of compassion for all.\n\n&gt;*Kindly Miquella... I see you've thrown away... Something you should not have. Under any circumstances. How will you salvation offer...to those who cannot be saved? When you could not even save your other self?*\n\nNot far from the Stone Coffin Fissure, he leaves his Doubt and Vacillation. \"Vacillation\" is a wavering indesiciveness. Without context, one would likely accept that this was him merely abandoning his doubts about godhood.\n\nWith context, we can see a much darker meaning; With Trina's abandonment, he also abandons her ability to stir doubt in him, something he intends to strip away from everyone around him.\n\n# Abandoned Albinaurics, the Violent Haligtree, and Forsaken Castle Sol\n\nThere is other evidence to consider that speaks to Miquella's true nature. I'll be a bit more brief on these points, as there is less information to work with.\n\n**Albinaurics**\n\nLoretta was rumored to be an Albinauric, and wished to venture to the Haligtree to give them a safe haven. Why is it, then, that Loretta is the *only* Albinauric in the Haligtree?\n\nSuspiciously, her weapon's glintstone was replaced with Unalloyed Gold, something closely associated with Miquella's ability to charm others - something that adorns all of his knights and soldiers in the form of an Unalloyed Gold circlet.\n\nAll the other Albinaurics meanwhile, are either protecting, or *inside* of, an Evergaol in Ordina. An Evergaol is *literally* a prison, it's right there in the word. Why? It's not as if the evergaol makes the puzzle any harder - you can just walk into it. For gameplay reasons? The puzzle of Ordina is similar to the puzzle of Sellia, and the latter is not in an Evergaol, so this does not explain it. It seems intentional. Regardless of the truth, Loretta remains the only Albinauric in the Haligtree that we know of.\n\nThe Black Knives, who killed Godwyn, are also there. It's possible that Miquella did not like the Albinaurics very much either, and wanted to keep them at an arm's length from the Haligtree, but still found use in having them defend its entrance.\n\nAlbus and Latenna certainly seem to *think* they were welcome there. But they only have one half of the secret medallion, and when we finally grant it to Latenna, she eventually remarks that her destiny is in fact not with the actual Haligtree after all, but with her sister, Phillia, who is alone at the Apostate Derelict.\n\nSuch helpless people deserve the safety of the Haligtree, especially a person who is implied to be the very source of hope for Latenna's people. And yet, Phillia sits in the cold of an abandoned church.\n\n**Fun side-note:** Earlier, I mentioned the placement of Trina's lilies near some places where the undead walked. There are *tons* of Trina's Lilies in both the Albinauric Village and the Apostate Derelict. There is only *one* of Miquella's Lilies in the Albinauric Village. Exactly one. And there is exactly one Albinauric in Elphael.\n\nYou can find most of Miquella's Lillies in Caelid (around half of which are in Sellia... Radahn-bros?), Liurnia, and Leyndell. I'm not sure there's much to extract here, but I think at least some of their placements provide clues to their respective affections.\n\n**The Haligtree, not so much of a sanctuary**\n\n&gt;*Gauntlets worn by soldiers sworn to the Haligtree.*  \n*Rust-worn and stained through* ***unending conflict***.\n\n\\- Haligtree Soldier Gauntlets\n\nUnending conflict with who? The Golden Order never seems to invade, or even acknowledge, the Haligtree. No Demigod in the Shattering appears to ever go there either, except Mogh who came *once* to steal Miquella and never returned. Even if they are now paranoid of intruders, there is no *invasion* happening.\n\nBallistae-armed deathtraps, a fully armored Loretta, patrolling battlemages, and unalloyed armored knights protect the brace of the Haligtree. There is less resistance on the way to the Elden Throne than Miquella's sanctuary.\n\nWhen the Haligtree soldiers, described as seeing 'unending conflict', are weakened, they willingly *explode* as a final and fanatical defense.\n\n&gt;*Spirits of common soldiers who carry the sacred light. When weakened, they explode to deliver a last-ditch attack.*  \n*This was the bitter revelation discovered by the desperate soldiers who awaited the return of their lord to the rotted Haligtree.*\n\n&gt;***May the flash of our deaths guide Miquella's return.***\n\n\\- Haligtree Soldier Ashes\n\nThis effect comes from a crystal tear, which we can find ourselves.\n\n&gt;*A defective crystal tear which possesses* ***absolutely no medicinal qualities***. *A lesson said to be learned the hard way for some;* ***faith can be a volatile matter, after all.***\n\nIt's fitting that Malenia, Blade of Miquella, also *exploded* into Scarlet Rot when Radahn had weakened her - a final and last-ditch attack meant to kill him, all so her beloved brother could claim his soul.\n\n**Castle Sol's Eclipse**\n\nEarlier, I established my belief that Miquella wanted Godwyn to have a 'true death', one the Golden Order could not give.\n\nAnd so, when Miquella abandoned Fundamentalism, he searched for a new solution - one outside of its tradition.\n\n&gt;*... Ohh great sun! Frigid sun of Sol! Surrender yourself to the eclipse! Grant life to the soulless bones!*\n\n\\- 'Eclipse Spirit' at Castle Sol\n\n&gt;*Lord Miquella, forgive me. The sun has not been swallowed.* *Our prayers were lacking. Your comrade remains soulless...* ***I will never set my eyes upon it now. Your divine Haligtree.***\n\n\\- 'Medallion Spirit' at Castle Sol\n\nI know this is a complicated rabbit-hole of a topic that many people have tried giving a crack at, and it distracts from my point. I may, in the future, make a post or video about my own take on the Eclipse.\n\nBecause Miquella's opinions of Those Who Live in Death are an important point in my post, however, I'll briefly touch on this. I believe the 'Eclipse' is, simply put, the fully restored Cursemark of Death. The Eclipse Shotel, which the above 'Eclipse Spirit' is praying to, looks suspiciously similar to the Halfwheel Cursemark on both Godwyn and Ranni's body.\n\n&gt;*Cursemark carved into the discarded flesh of Ranni the Witch.*  \n*Also known as the half-wheel wound of the centipede.*\n\n&gt;*This cursemark was carved at the moment of Death of the first demigod,*  \n*and should have taken the shape of a circle.*\n\nThe fully restored cursemark - something which, in theory, would have given Godwyn a true death - looks suspiciously like an Eclipse. You can look these up for yourself, if you'd like.\n\nMiquella did not fully understand what happened to Godwyn. How could he? We are the first person to uncover the **full** details of Ranni's conspiracy, something only possible by doing Ranni's questline and being granted the key to the inverted Carian Study Hall. This allows us to access Ranni's true body and retrieve the other halfwheel, the key missing ingredient in this puzzle.\n\nPerhaps he somehow approached the truth, a fragmented idea of this 'Eclipse', but could not finish the puzzle. In either case, Castle Sol fails at the strange task Miquella gave them.\n\n&gt;***I will never set my eyes upon it now.*** *Your Divine Haligtree.*\n\nGiving Castle Sol only *half* of the Secret Medallion, Miquella purposefully coaxes them with an incomplete key to his supposed sanctuary, demanding they *do the impossible* to earn the other half.\n\nHe didn't have to give them a useless *half* of a key - it was a carrot on a stick, and a cruel thing to do. Even as their spirits, *to this day,* continue to desperately pray for the Eclipse and beg Miquella for forgiveness, they are left in the cold without answer.\n\nIf a person sees someone cold and alone on the street, gives them half of a bus ticket to a warm shelter, then says they can have the other half *after* they fully calculate every digit of Pi, are they a kind person? No.\n\n# \n\n# Conclusion - Cursed with eternal youth\n\nKindly Miquella is not *truly* kind, and never really was, even if he tried to be. He is a child with pretty ideas, ideas which, like him, never fully mature. Like some children, he shows selfish and manipulative behavior to get what he wants - a tactic that often works. Children don't really do this consciously, and he likely didn't either.\n\nHe likely lived his entire life never actually thinking what he was doing was wrong, and earnestly did do selfless things that showed his desire to be kind. Still, when you have the natural ability to compel peoples' affections, you likely don't ever hear criticism. All you see is others' adoration of you. Of course, when the world begins to crack, he reaches out his hand to help.\n\nThat's what really makes him so terrifying. His inconsistencies, manipulations of others, and the problems with his Age of Compassion are all invisible to him, because his power makes it invisible to others. With just the slightest exposure, you too will be unable to see those flaws, and be willing to die for him, regardless of what evidence lies before you. Regardless of what pain you had before facing him.\n\n&gt;*Miquella the Kind...* ***is a monster.***  \n*Pure and radiant, he wields love to shrive clean the hearts of men.*  \n***There is nothing more terrifying.***\n\n\\- Ansbach\n\n&gt;*My brother will keep his promise. He possesses the wisdom, the allure, of a god \u2013* ***he is the most fearsome Empyrean of all.***\n\n\\- Malenia\n\nEdited:\n\nRephrasing to further clarify that I don't actually think Miquella is some cartoonish, one-dimensional evil. My phrasing is obviously pretty harsh, but this was framed as a response to arguments that say Miquella was only ever kind, had a completely justified goal, and that only his actions on reaching that goal were bad. The Age of Compassion was just as bad as the methods he used to achieve it, and his character in other endeavors showed cracks in that kindness, even if he was not aware of them.\n\nOf course, this is just my theory. You're free to believe in what you want, and I could have missed important things that contradict my arguments. Elden Ring's lore is full of detail and very easy to run wild with. After seeing so many posts and videos ignoring these jarring details of Miquella, though, I felt I had to stir the pot a little...",

The entire analysis is based on taking the fact that it can't be used to kill Godwyn towards the direction that his aim was to kill Those who Live in Death to honor Godwyn. It's just as possible that Godwyn's state was something they'd never seen before but resembled the regular Those who Live in Death, so Miquella assumed a regular weapon for permanently killing Those who Live in Death would have worked. Or it could actually have worked but he never had the chance, but the quest just doesn't give us the option because the whole point of the Godwyn questline is to turn him into a Mending Rune. I find the \"Miquella must have resented Those who Live in Death\" argument unconvincing. I mean, the lore outright states what Miquella was thinking, not even \"he's said to have XXX\" but his own quotes. I know even item descriptions can't always be taken at face value, but this doesn't seem to be it.\n\nSimilarly, just because we don't personally witness an invasion on the Haligtree or know a faction that's currently out to destroy them, that doesn't mean there hasn't been one. Malenia has been fighting off enemies that reach all the way into where she waits, the deepest place of Elphael. This is a case of outright dismissing what's explicitly stated in the lore and makes the difficulty sensible in order to reach a certain conclusion. The self-detonating soldiers are also overly dramatized: yes, it's obviously a horrific sight, but it's just one case of people of faith going crazy in a state of desperation. It speaks nothing about Miquella, and we can turn the analysis the other way if we wanted, that if Miquella was around such a sacrifice would never have been even allowed.\n\nThis analysis also dismisses the presence of misbegottens and omens in the Haligtree. I think I also remember a video that pointed out that there are Albinaurics in the Haligtree, but in cocoon state.\n\nOverall, while I have no interest in making Miquella out to be more justified than he deserves to be, I think this analysis is mostly taking the vagueness of lore to flatten a character's complexities, depths, layers and imperfections into a simple \"oh he's just evil\" sentence. I'd much prefer analyzing characters in terms of their layers. It makes more sense for him to be a child who doesn't fully understand the implications of his actions and what it means to truly commit to something, than for him to be an evil genius mastermind who's perfect at manipulating everyone.",

I consider this to be the most likely answer, simply because I find that it makes the most sense and there is more reasoning and links to this conclusion than any other theory I have read (and I have read a lot). I also believe this is why we didn't really get any GEQ lore in the DLC, because there is plenty of evidence in the base game. I would be very happy to be proven wrong and to hear a better theory. \n\n\n\n**Who is the Gloam Eyed Queen (The Queen in Black)?**  \nMarika, and by extension, Melina, who is an offshoot/daughter/reincarnation of Marika.\n\n**When on the timeline did the \"God Hunt\" occur?**   \nShortly before Marika became \"Marika the Eternal\".\n\n**What God/s was hunted?**  \nThe Fell God, spread across the Trolls. The Trolls were skinned and the Fell God was cut out of the Trolls abdomen and replaced with a tablet, which likely contains magical properties that can ward off the Fell Gods influence. The trolls that are not skinned are those who originally betrayed the Fell God and the Fire Giants, and joined Marika and Godfrey's forces during the war. Now they remain as guards to the Forge of the Giants.\n\n**Why did she do this?**  \nOn top of the fact that they were a huge threat to her in general, it is stated that the Fell God also \"*haunts the sagas of the Hornsent*\". We know that Marika had some kind of alliance with the Hornsent, likely because she needed access to the Gate of Divinity. What better way to gain their trust than defeating an enemy that has haunted them for generations.\n\n**How did she do this?**  \nEven before becoming a God, Marika had already amassed great power and many allies. She was also an Empyrean, meaning she had direct ties to Metyr.\n\n**The elephant in the room, Malekith, and why he would have \"defeated\" her.**  \n*\"Marika's sole need of her shadow was a vessel to lock away Destined Death. Even then, she betrayed him.\".* This explains it all since it's well known that Marika wanted to remove death all together. She planned for Malekith to defeat her and seal away Destined Death once she had finished using it's power. She used him, and that is how she betray him.\n\n\n\n**My reasoning and \"evidence\" (I'll try to organise it):**\n\n* The Godskin weapons are large, and that is even made clear in their item description. This likely means that they were used for skinning large creatures, such as the Trolls.\n* The Godskins have \"assimilated\" inhuman physiology, similar to that of the crucible. Assimilate is an interesting word to have been used, meaning that they took in these traits from somewhere. The Furnace Visage depicts the Fell God surrounded in horns, directly linking it to the crucible.\n* Trolls, which are descended from Giants, all have the front of their abdomens carved out. This is the same location where the Fell God sits on the Fire Giant we face. All the trolls, except for those found in the mountain tops, appear to be flayed. The natural skin colour of the Trolls also appears to be white, matching that of the Godskins attire.\n* The Noble Presence incantation mirrors that of the roar of the Trolls and the eruption attack move during the 2nd phase of the Fire Giant. It's description states: \"*Once a sign of the gods' wrath, this incantation became a trophy\u00a0of the Nobles' god hunt.*\"\n* The Godskins Noble Robe has 7 faces in a circle with a sigil at the bottom that looks an awful lot like Metyr, and another symbol in the center. This pattern is the same as the Fell Gods Eye, eight circles surrounding a center circle.\n* The Trolls have golden/yellow eyes, the same as the faces on the Godskin Noble Robes. The Trolls face even share a similar all-round tentacle like feature to these faces.\n* The Furnace Visage is said to depict the Fell God, but the Fell God typically has only one eye. This makes sense though if the Furnace Visage is actually depicting the face of a Troll, which is similar in design.\n* The Godslayer's Seal and the sigil for Black Flame Incantations look a lot like Metyrs head.\n* Blackflame Monk Amon is said to have fled from the Giants Flame when he swore fealty to the Black Flame. Why turn to the Black Flame? Why make this connection between the Fell God/Fire Monks and the Black Flame/GEQ?\n* It is specifically stated that the Fell God was said to have been slain by Marika.\n* The cave where we find the Godskin Swaddling Cloth is right near where the Battle against the Giants took place, and the First Church of Marika.\n* It is stated that the Age of the Erdtree began right after the war against the giants when the Trolls betrayed and fire was vanquished. It makes sense that this happened, Marika gained the trust of the Hornsent and got access to the Gate of Divinity, allowing her to become a God, Marika the Eternal.\n* The frenzied trolls in the snowfields are likely Trolls who managed to escape or were set loose because they were afflicted by frenzy due to the trauma they went through.\n* The trolls with Fur in the mountain tops have fur and guard the forge because they are the Trolls that betray the giants and joined with Marika. People say that they have fur \"because it's cold\". I know it's a game, but evolution doesn't just happen like that, and the other trolls are very clearly skinned/flayed and are not just simply missing their fur.\n* There are only 2-3 trolls in the Shadow of the Erdtree, likely because Marika removed them as part of her plan to gain the trust of the Hornsent.\n* How could Marika have gotten away with all this? Marika is already known to have rewritten the history books and hide her own past. People in the Lands Between know these events happened, but her name has just been removed and replaced with the Gloam Eyed Queen.\n* Rykard speaks \"blasphemy\", likely about Marika's past. There are a lot of dead trolls on the Road to Iniquity that have likely been tortured and interrogated for information, but there is a single Frenzied Troll right outside Volcano Manor. I would guess that this Troll was tortured and revealed the truth about Marika to Rykard and his Inquisitors before succumbing to frenzy and going mad.\n\n\n\nHope you enjoyed",

    "body": "Revisiting this cutscene.  Let's start from the (challengable) position that From put it in there for a specific reason. On the surface, it's pointless because it is re-delivering information already given to us in multiple other places.\n\n**Miquella is asking his brother to make a promise** in person. Not that Radahn took the initiative to make a promise. This is a very important distinction when the one doing the asking demonstrably compels affection/obedience in every single other example we have of him interacting with people directly.\n\nMaybe a bit bold of a theory, but I don't think this is much of a debate.  Miquella asks Radahn for something and Radahn has to do it.  I actually find this to be extremely straightforward even though \"Was Radahn charmed?\" and the nature of Miquella's charming ability have been hotly argued as topics.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID, there are still questions:\n\n* Leda and Dane don't need the charm to be loyal to Miquella, but are affected regardless to make them accepting of the others in the party.  Miquella compelling the vow does not necessarily mean it was entirely against Radahn's wishes.\n* Does Miquella have total control over his ability to compel affection such that it is always a purposeful act, or can it happen inadvertently?\n* **Miquella compelled a promise for an act, not the act itself, which opens the door to all sorts of possibilities, including Radahn trying things to circumvent it.**\n\nRandom related questions:\n\n* Radahn and Jerren made oaths to each other for honorable deaths.  Why was that needed if he already had one with Miquella/Malenia?\n* If Radahn expected to become Miquella's Lord, why did he siege Leyndell and challenge Morgott as part of the Shattering War, something only an aspiring Lord of Marika would need to do?\n* If Radahn is satisfied by his honorable end, why is he ok with being dragged back?\n* Why would Radahn, a man obsessed with war and honorable combat, be interested in lording over an Age of Compassion?\n\nAnsbach is so convinced by the idea that Radahn wouldn't want to return that he assumes it would convince Freyja to side with him in stopping the ritual. But she is too obsessed with Radahn's warlike persona to understand the true implications and is only excited that Radahn can return and keep fighting. Totally oblivious to the fact that the Age he is returning for is to be one lacking merit-based stature and lessened/no conflict. Ansbach only laughs at how stupid Freyja is.\n\nEDIT: Our boy Ansbach would never call someone stupid, and pedantic people have taken issue with my wording.  He's saying he thought she would act a certain way based on provided information and then did the opposite, which is both amusing to him but also sort of expected.  Which some might concisely call 'being stupid'.\n\ntl;dr There are major inconsistencies to this story and what we know about Radahn, I believe it is reasonable to conclude that the vow was against his wishes.",

The Night of Black Knives was designed not merely to kill the scions of the golden lineage, but to resurrect them as Lords for a new Age of Night, with Godwyn as the crucial element.\n\nI believe the Night of Black Knives was a failed three-way ritual. Godwyn's aim was to become a god, specifically a Dragon Lord. According to the 'sacred scroll rites,' this transformation requires the prospective god to die and then be reborn into a new vessel. Godwyn was likely attempting to be reborn in the vessel of a dragon to achieve this Lordship.\n\nThe Nox, using their silver tear experiments, were attempting to create a Lord by crafting flexible vessels capable of absorbing stray souls, one of which might become strong enough for the role. (There\u2019s a controversial theory that suggests Godwyn is a mimic; I disagree, but I do believe some mimic tears were created to potentially house Godwyn's soul.)\n\nGodwyn, I believe, intended to die regardless, pursuing his own agenda. This was separate from the Nox's goals and Ranni's goals. The Nox thwarted Godwyn's plans, only to have their own plans subsequently foiled by Ranni, who was likely allied with the Nox before she acted against them.\n\nThis plot may have involved most of the Carians, including Radagon, as eliminating much of the Golden Lineage would have significantly elevated the status of the Carian children and, by extension, Radagon himself.",

    "body": "I accidentally deleted this post yesterday because Reddit trolled me by making it appear that it double posted. I deleted the duplicate post, and then they both deleted -.- So here it is once again:\n\nWhether the Moons are true Outer Gods or not, has long been up for debate. There\u2019s good evidence to suggest that they could be, and good evidence to suggest they aren\u2019t! But perhaps there is a secret third option; The Moons are attempting to become Outer Gods!\n\nFirst and foremost, I believe that the people of TLB are communicating with the moons through scrying. They have figured out a way to talk to moons, and that is by using a form of water divination. These are what the moon gazing grounds are for. \n\nScrying is essentially staring into a reflective surface to receive divine messages or visions. If you look at the moon gazing grounds, this becomes evident: https://imgur.com/a/jhcdpBJ\n\nThere are multiple item descriptions that mention people \u201cmeeting\u201d moons. I don\u2019t believe that there were moons flying around TLB that only 1 person sees. I think it\u2019s much more likely that their civilization discovered some kind of magic formula for finding and communicating with moon entities. \n\nThere are 4 named moons in Elden Ring. There\u2019s not really a whole lot of information about the moons individually, but when we add all the information together, we start to uncover a cosmic conspiracy! \n\nBlack Moon: It is the lost Moon of the Nox, and it guided many stars. It also possessed extremely powerful magic which essentially was the reason that the Nox worshipped it. I believe that the Black Moon could be the same as the next moon on this list. \n\nDark Moon: This is Rannis moon, It\u2019s described as cold and dark. Another description we get, is it being veiled in occult mystery. The Dark Moon was something to be feared, according to Rannis teacher. Despite her teachers fear of the Dark Moon, Ranni would refuse her teachers warnings, being the rebel she is. Interestingly enough, there are instances where Ranni makes her followers swear their loyalty not to her, but to the Dark Moon itself. \n\nTime and time again, Ranni proclaims that she is following the guidance of the dark moon, and professes it one last time in her Age of Stars cutscene. In this cutscene, we witness a black moon sit just beyond the light, not revealing itself to us until Ranni presents the Elden Ring to it. As the Elden Ring dissipates, we see the moon come into the light, and suck it into its mouth, and it\u2019s also sucking in what appears to be stars, even galaxies! https://imgur.com/a/AevUd1o\n\nThe reason I believe this is the missing moon of the Nox, is because the Nox notoriously failed to ever have a lord and get the Elden Ring. In Rannis ending, we see a black moon sitting just beyond the light, but once Ranni presents the Elden Ring, it shows itself and its worm hole mouth that guides the stars. Just as the Black Moon of the Nox guided the stars. \n\nRennalas Full Moon: There is 1 reference to this in the entire game. And that is the item description for the spell: \u201cQueen Rennala encountered this enchanting moon at a young age, and it would later bewitch the academy.\u201d\n\nIt may not be much to go on, but it does give us some very important insight. The Full Moon literally cast a spell over the people of the academy. This isn\u2019t a small detail, this has implications. \n\nThe final named moon is actually 2 moons, Rellanas Twin Moons. Again not a lot of information outside of the item description: \u201cIn her childhood, she and her older sister Rennala met these moons. Overlapping, as if they were nestled against each other.\u201d \n\nNot much to take away from the item description, but the name of the item does tell us something interesting. Twin Moon. \n\nWhat about the moon that we can actually see in the sky? And the identical one that only appears when you visit the moonlight altar? The Twin Moons are the moons we see in the sky. But the moon in the sky, is also Rannis moon, and didn\u2019t I theorize earlier that Rannis moon is actually the Black moon? \n\nIf Rellanas moon bewitched the academy, how deep does that rabbit hole really go? What if the twin moons, the full moon, the dark moon, and the black moon, are just these 2 moons. They are literally twin moons after all. 4 different moons that are named, each moon has at least 2 distinct sides. \n\nThere\u2019s 1 more instance of the moons having the ability to bewitch people. The Eclipse of Sol. \n\nEclipse Shotel: \u201cIn Sol, the sight of an eclipse inspires a dreadful awe, preventing an onlooker from averting his gaze.\"\n\nSo we know these moons are going around TLB bewitching people, but why? My theory is that they are assimilating with Great Runes, to become an Outer God. \n\nWe see people ascend to Gods, and we see people ascend to celestial bodies. But there\u2019s a higher level to ascend to yet. If you\u2019re a celestial body with godlike powers, maybe the thing that makes you ascend to the level of an Outer God is assimilating with enough Great Runes. \n\nIm not certain if they are literally ascending to a higher plane of existence. But in theory, if you were a celestial god and assimilated with enough great runes, you would have Outer God level powers. \n\nWe do see what seems to be Great Runes inscribed on the Twin Moons already. And Great Runes can hold incredible powers. Individually the Great Runes have the power to shape reality. But when we bring them together and create the Elden Ring, they have the power to create and destroy worlds. \n\nWe see what Marika is capable of when she gets her hands on the Elden Ring, imagine if a hyper intelligent magical moon god got it. Imagine if they went from world to world taking the Elden Rings and got multiple of them! \n\nWas Ranni bewitched? Was she being manipulated? I believe that she was. Just going off of the track record for the rest of the Outer Gods, they\u2019re all manipulating the people of TLB for their own gain. All for the same thing, they\u2019re all after the Elden Ring. \n\nRanni wanted to get rid of order after being forced into it. She saw the evil that Marika brought to the world, and decided that order was the problem, and that life would be better without it. The Moon promised to do that, by taking the Elden Ring away from TLB. \n\nRanni is just a character, she doesn\u2019t have the meta knowledge about the universe that we have. These moons were deeply ingrained in her culture at this point, and they offered her a solution to get rid of order. But the implications of this are far greater than you think. \n\nThink about it. If the Elden Ring could exist in space and still control TLB, why would the Greater Will have to send it to the planet at all? \n\nI don\u2019t think the Greater Will is the all powerful being we make it out to be. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s still essentially the creator god of the universe, but it can only create order with the One Greats universal DNA. This being has its limits, it can\u2019t even directly communicate with the people of TLB. \n\nIf the Elden Ring could exist in space, and it could still be controlled by the people of TLB, it would be. It would be somewhere safe, out of harms way. \n\nThere\u2019s one small and seemingly unimportant story that Fromsoft added to the DLC for absolutely no reason. But there was a reason, the story of Onze brings this theory full circle.\n\nStar-Lined Sword: \u201cSword encrusted with a line of stars fashioned from small pieces of crude glintstone. Weapon of the demi-human swordsmen. When bestowed with this weapon by their queen, the swordsmen swear to find the truth that lies at the end of the procession of the stars.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cProcession of the stars\u201d is a fittingly vague way for Fromsoft to let us know that we are talking about the age of stars ending. First let\u2019s look at the definition of Procession. \n\nProcession means: To move forward in an orderly fashion. \n\nSwordmaster Onze: \u201cOnze, a master swordsman who devoted himself to the Star-Lined Sword, realized that only ruin awaited at the end of the procession of stars, and imprisoned himself in order to forestall it.\u201d\n\nRuin awaits at the end of the procession of stars. \nI don\u2019t know about you, but I certainly don\u2019t think Miyazaki was trying to tell us not to do a conga line with the stars. What \u201corder\u201d means in this context, is the Elden Ring. \n\nWhat this item description is really saying is \u201cSending the Elden Ring to the stars will leave TLB in ruin.\u201d Which is, the Age of Stars ending. \n\nSo yeah, the Moons are pretty fucked.",

There was also a Trina Lily-ridden cave, a Divine Tower which hosted a Dancing Lion, and a sunken titan body (also a floating ?trunk? full of darkness. \n\nOne of our narrators speaks of the aftermath of the Night. I don\u2019t know what this aftermath is, but I suppose that after all the fighting over the past months there is some sort of reaction, thus resulting in the new characters, settings, and bosses. \n\nOur two new \u201cNight\u201d Lords are an assembly of seeming angels and the Dreglord. The \u201cangels\u201d are seen when fate is mentioned, making me wonder if there is some connection. The texture of their \u201cflesh\u201d reminds me of Malenia\u2019s rot and partly metallic body making me wonder if they\u2019re a recycle of earlier mechanics regarding Malenia (apparently she was supposed to summon her blossom copies as long standing enemies according to the Japanese content creator Chaos Silver Moon in a comment; haven\u2019t seen anyone else mention it). They may be Death\u2019s Envoys, or something to do with the Greater Will given their heavenly appearance. I expect they may be called Valkyries. \n\nMalenia was called a Valkyrie in reference to her wings (which could be seen; figuratively?; even before her revival as a goddess), or perhaps it was in reference for her skill in delivering death? Valkyries carry warriors to the afterlife and the Night has been delivering death for some time. \n\nAlso, the ultimate ends of one\u2019s fate is death, so perhaps that line is relevant? \n\nThe Dreglord is my curiosity. He is filthy, vibrant, and we only get a glance from afar. Whatever he is, I want to see. Dregs are remnants, waste, somewhat referenced in Dark Souls 3 when the world is coming to an end. Not that there\u2019s an immediate connection, but his power looks like the summoning of waste. The Night has misconstrued time and place, like what happens at the end of Dark Souls 3. Dreg can also refer to sediment at the bottom of something, fitting into a theme of unwellness as the Japanese culture has a conception of something called kegare, spiritual filth, which is often associated with stagnant water as it doesn\u2019t flow, thus never filtering out, filling with dregs. In Dark Souls time has \u201cstopped\u201d (not convoluted) and the darkness and consequences of timelessness built up. I wonder, if anything, what may\u2019ve built up to create a Dreglord? Time, darkness, death?",

She is Marika, but she is still Marika's daughter and a sister to Messmer, the same way Millicent is a daughter to Malenia and has multiple siblings.\n\n\n\n**The Albinaurics**\n\nThe Black Knife assassins \"*were all women, and rumored to be Numen who had close ties with Marika herself*\". They appear to have long blonde hair when exposed. They fight the exact same way as Melina, and wield very similar weapons. Their actions and placement in the Lands Between suggest that they work for and are loyal to Marika. I believe Marika worked with or used the Nox to create artificial life and clone herself.\n\nGeneration 1: The first attempt, they succeeded in creating artificial life, but their legs didn't work and they couldn't reproduce. Interestingly, the women are all blonde and resemble Marika, and their connection to wolves can possibly be linked to the shrine in Malekiths arena.\n\nGeneration 2: The second attempt, which failed because they all turned out as frog-like abominations.\n\nGeneration 3: The third attempt, which succeeded. Silver Tears were born. They could take any form and they could reproduce (as seen from the Silver Tears \"dripping\" from the Silver Tear Ball in Nokstella.\n\nBonus: Both generation 1 and 2 Albinaurics can be found imprisoned, tortured and being interrogated at Mt Gelmir. Why would Rykard have any interest in interrogating, and likely studying, so many Albinaurics?\n\n\n\n**Melina, and how Alecto/Tiche + Malenia/Millicent are hints to the truth**\n\nMelina fights identically to a Black Knife Assassin, and carries a weapon that looks like it could be the Black Knife before it was embedded with Destined Death. She can recall Marika's echoes at Sites of Grace. She knows Marika's secret tree incantation. No one else in the game, other than Torrent, seems to know she exists. She also questions what it means to be born of a mother... why?\n\nAlecto was the ringleader of the Black Knife Assassins. We receive Tiche when she is defeated, who is her daughter that is a spirit (hint hint). Millicent and her siblings are offshoots of Malenia. Daughters, but also just reincarnations of Malenia herself (hint hint).\n\nIt may not be a simple explanation, but Melina being birthed/created in a similar fashion to a Silver Tear explains pretty much everything about her.",

All three, in their second line, state 'Used to restore the fractured elden ring when brandished by the elden lord.' At the end of the game, when you get access to the elden ring, you brandish it, you hold it up and potentially have the ability to change it. In Marika's spoken echo, she's telling godfrey and his men to do certain things before brandishing the elden ring. This implies they don't have access to the elden ring yet. If marika already had the ring, they could brandish it then and there. Defeating the giants and gaining access to the forge could have enabled godfrey to use the same warp gate to farum azula that the player uses in-game. I think when godfrey defeated placidusax he brought the elden ring back to marika and she ate it.",

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "The title basically states it. This theory of mine is addressing what the Seduction and Betrayal that was spoken in the DLC Story Trailer is.\n\n# What We Know\n\n*\u201cMiquella the Kind spoke of the beginning. The seduction. And the betrayal. An affair from which Gold arose. And so too was Shadow born. What followed was a war unseen. One that could never be put to song. A purge without Grace or honour. The tyranny of Messmer's flame. And so Kindly Miquella would abandon everything. His golden flesh, his blinding strength. Even his fate.\u201d*\n\nThe seduction and the betrayal are mentioned only once here. Just like almost everything involving what happened during Marika's ascension is never mentioned in the actual game. However there is enough to make a theory based on it.\n\nNow we know that the seduction and the betrayal most likely occurred during Marika's ascension or was involved with it as this event predates the creation of gold. Lets for now ignore the seduction and focus on the betrayal bit.\n\n# The Betrayal Of The Crusade\n\nNow we do know that Marika did betray the Hornsent at some point in the form of Messmer's crusade.\n\n*\u201cThe Erdtree is my peoples' enemy\u2014By Marika long betray'd, set aflame.\u201d*\n\n*\"Take vengeance upon Messmer and his lot. They who betrayed us, aye, they who burned us... Let them face in thy wrath their just deserts.\u201d*\n\nHowever this presents a problem, from everything we know the crusade happened long after Marika became a god as Messmer and Gaius are considered to be elder brothers to Radahn(Which means that Radahn at the minimum knew Messmer during his time at Sellia).\n\nThere is nothing in the game, concrete anyways, that references any other betrayal by Marika. From all that we can tell, the Erdtree and the Hornsent were on friendly terms. The only thing that would make sense is if Marika deceived the Hornsent to become a god, however this has no evidence. Not even the Hornsent Grandam ever accuses Marika of such. Not once is there a piece of lore that ever references(besides a vague statue that could mean anything) any betrayal on Marika\u2019s behalf during the ascension. No, the only betrayal to the Hornsent by Marika was the crusade.\n\n# Miquella's Atonement\n\nGoing off of Leda's words, Miquella's abandonment of everything is due to the aforementioned events. Thankfully, we do know quite a bit about Miquella's whole abandonment thing:\n\n*\"Miquella set off for the tower enshrouded by shadow, abandoning everything\u2014his golden flesh, his blinding strength, even his fate. All in an effort to bury the original sin. To embrace the whole of it, and be reborn as a new god.\"*\n\n*\"Ever-young Miquella saw things for what they were. He knew that his bloodline was tainted. His roots mired in madness. A tragedy if ever there was one. That he would feel compelled to renounce everything. When the blame... lay squarely with the mother.\"*\n\n*\"You must kill Miquella... Grant him forgiveness.\"*\n\n*\"Well, I am much obliged. I can hardly believe it, he's divested himself of his very eye\u2026 Tender Miquella's eye is no mere morsel of flesh. It is a vessel of soaring grace. Proof of his Empyrean lineage. I wonder, does Miquella the Kind intend to sever his very birthright? His fate as a child of the Erdtree?\"*\n\n\n\nMiquella wanted to renounce his very flesh as a form of atonement for the sin created by his mother. Only then could he embrace the whole of it and be reborn as a new god, free of the grace of gold.\n\nNow the Original Sin is something that is quite interesting. Its important to note that the japanese for this is better translated as \u2018Causality\u2019 unlike the mention of the original sin in Messmer\u2019s remembrance. However I do believe that they are both talking of the same sin as the creation of causality was the sin created long ago.\n\n# The Causality of Gold &amp; Shadow\n\nThe affair that happened at the beginning created Gold. However, Shadow was created too. Gold in this case is the gold of Order, the Scadutree is the opposite. The chaotic crucible that thrives outside of Order.\n\n*\"The Scadutree is the shadow of the Erdtree.*  \n*Born of dark notions that bear no sense of Order, that twist and bend its stock, rendering it brittle.\"*\n\nThe Scadutree(The main part of the tree) exists because the lands of the tower still are influenced by the crucible(Most likely because the Crucible originated from this land as Devonia\u2019s items suggest). The Land of Shadow falls outside of the Erdtrees golden light. For the crucible has long lost its strength under the golden light of the Erdtree.\n\n*\"The Crucible has a particularly strong influence on the beasts of the realm of shadow, causing many to grow horns despite the characteristics of their species(DLC)\"*\n\n*\"This horn began to sprout on a beast that typically bears no horn. Perhaps it's a vestige of the primordial crucible(BASE GAME).\"*\n\nThere is also another interesting parallel with the Sword of light and the Sword of Darkness. The Sword of Lights' light is unswerving(meaning not changing) and the Sword of Darkness is made of wandering coils of darkness that creates vortices and eddies.\n\nThis division in the natural order of the world is the Original Sin, the causality created by Marika at the beginning. This division is why Miquella seeks to abandon everything(His blinding strength, his golden flesh, and the fate of a child of the Erdtree). For in order to embrace everything, he must no longer be a part of the causality. He refuses to be a god with the same causality affecting him, so it must go before he becomes a god.\n\n\n\n# SEDUCTION AND BETRAYAL\n\nNow we finally get to the main part of this. I propose that the seduction and the betrayal is not an act that Marika did, but an act done towards Marika by the fingers.\n\n\"*I fear that you have borne witness to the whole of it. The conceits \u2013 the hypocrisy \u2013 of the world built upon the Erdtree. The follies of men. Their bitter suffering. Is there no hope for redemption? The answer, sadly, is clear. There never was any hope. They were each of them defective. Unhinged, from the start. Marika herself. And the fingers that guided her. And this is what troubles me. No matter our efforts, if the roots are rotten, \u2026then we have little recourse.\"*\n\nWhile Ymir is a bit biased, the important part of this is that the fingers are what guided her. This makes sense as there is a finger ruin near the shaman village. The fingers are what lead her to godhood, a godhood that Marika came to regret.\n\n\n\n\u201c*Secret incantation of Queen Marika.*  \n*Only the kindness of gold, without Order.*\n\n*Creates a small, illusory Erdtree that continuously restores the HP of nearby allies.*\n\n*Marika bathed the village of her home in gold,*  \n*knowing full well that there was no one to heal.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cA braid of golden hair, cut loose. Queen Marika's offering to the Grandmother.*\n\n*Boosts holy damage negation by the utmost.*\n\n*What was her prayer? Her wish, her confession? There is no one left to answer, and Marika never returned home again.\u201d*\n\n\n\nThe kindness of gold, without Order. An incantation that Marika made in secret and is in the form of the Erdtree(Which does imply that Marika came here after the Erdtree began). It is here that Marika cut off a braid of hair and gave her wish, her confession, her prayer to the Grandmother and left her home to never return. The reason for this: She realized she had been tricked and deceived right from the start.\n\n\u201c*I declare mine intent,*\n\n*to search the depths of the Golden Order.*\n\n*Through understanding of the proper way,*\n\n*our faith, our grace, is increased.*\n\n*Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past.*\n\n*My comrades;*\n\n*why must ye falter?\"*\n\n\n\n*\"Then, after thy death,*\n\n*I will give back what I once claimed.*\n\n*Return to the Lands Between, \u00a0wage war,*\n\n*and brandish the Elden Ring.\"*\n\n\n\n*\"O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.\"*\n\n\n\n*\"Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness. The road is yet long. A God is not easily felled. But one day, without fail, you will have your wish. So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika...\"*\n\n\n\n*\"Are you having second thoughts? Might I have a word, then?*  \n*Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.*  \n*The demigods. And their god.*  \n*If you remain loyal to your calling, then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,*  \n*I will never cease to smith your weapons. Until you have one to slay a god.\"*\n\n\n\nMarika eventually came to conspire against the Golden Order, even disdaining it as she insults Radagon for his unyielding loyalty. She forsook her first lord and his men, chained a misbegotten to the Roundtable Hold, and shattered the very source of her godhood. All of it done to kill the very incarnation of Order.\n\nFor Marika finally realized the truth, that divinity was a cage and she has walked into a cage even worse. For she is no true god. She is merely a puppet held on the strings of a beast that has always been in charge for it is the very Elden Ring itself. This was why she ordered her lord and his men to brandish the Elden Ring once they returned. For in slaying the Elden Beast, Order can only be defined by the wielder. No more can the vassal of the Greater Will define Order.\n\nThis is the seduction and the betrayal. Marika was seduced by the fingers with the offering of divinity. A divinity that can bless all with a golden kindness. No more is divinity defined by something one is birthed with. Now divinity would be certain, observable. A giant golden tree that spills forth blessings for all, forever. That is the promise of Marika the Eternal. An eternal age of golden kindness.  \n  \nHowever, this wasn't to last. For the Erdtree ran dry and blessing no longer spilled forth and the blessed grace of gold became restrained by Order. Those not accepted by Order were forsaken, including three of her own children. I wonder if Order itself was what caused the Age of Plenty to end. After all, the Scadutree that isn't affected by Order still has golden sap.  \n\nThe betrayal in the end was that everything was for naught. Her children having to be hidden away from the world, her people that were assumingly killed for divine tower(Tree people at Enir-illim and that shaman flesh melds harmoniously well), and her age filled with stagnancy. That age of kindness was desecrated all in the name of Order.\n\nSo Marika, her faith broken, stand before the Grandmother and offers a braid of Golden Hair. For she, like her son, offers a part of her golden self as atonement. For everything she has sacrificed for, was for nothing in the end. And from that moment onward, all she desired was to right the world, to atone the only way she could. To create the end that should not be.\n\nI wonder if Miquella knew of all of this, for that might be why he forsook his other half and his doubts. So that he would not become like his mother, and realize the truth that St. Trina knew: \"*Godhood would be Miquella's prison. A caged divinity... is beyond saving.\"*\n\nTLDR:  \nThe Seduction and the Betrayal was the Fingers tricking Marika into becoming a god for her age of kindness, only for her to be nothing more than a vessel for the Elden Beast\u2019s Order.\n\n",

    "body": "Entangled somewhere deep within the convoluted web of maniacal genius that is Elden Ring lore, is a story of evolution and devolution. But this post isn\u2019t about that, however the concept at its most basic core is important for understanding this theory. \n\nYou only need to understand 1 thing. Ancient things were big and strong, but generally speaking they got smaller and weaker over time.\n\nUnderstanding the link between the Hornsent and the Ancestral followers will also explain some of the mysterious similarities between the Nox and the Hornsent, and it may explain the biggest secret of them all, Elden John. \n\nLet\u2019s kick this off with the most obvious connection between the Hornsent and the Ancestral Followers, physical features: https://imgur.com/a/t733Ovi\n\nI theorize that Ancestral Followers are to Hornsent, what Neandrathals are to Humans. The species that we most evolved from and eventually took over. \n\nBoth the Hornsent and the Ancestral Followers have white hair, they wear it with and without braids. They\u2019re both pale skinned, and most importantly they both have a fascination with horns. \n\nWhile the Ancestral Followers do not have real horns anymore, their gods do: https://imgur.com/a/aYJepZu \n\nYou can see that on the Ancestral Spirit the horns are becoming smaller compared to the Hornsents Divine Beast. This, plus the missing horns on the Ancestral Followers heads, tells us that either this society is dying, or that they weren\u2019t as deep into Crucible worship as the Hornsent would go on to be. I think the answer is both.\n\nWe do have some evidence to suggest that their society is failing. We actually find them in the over world, found guarding a minor Erdtree. Pushed to desperation they came above ground to look for solace in the thing that forced them underground to begin with.\n\nI believe their desperation is because Marika turned the Crucible into the Erdtree, and removed destined death. As a result of Marikas actions, all things crucible and death related got either completely destroyed or severely weakened.\n\nWe can also see that they do have some crucible imagery in their society but nothing like the Hornsent do: https://imgur.com/a/aOw3F7z \n\nThe hair, the golden spiral headband, and the horns all suggest that they were aware on some level of the Crucible; But the lack of it in their architecture and artwork tells us that they were not as fixated on the same aspects of it as the Hornsent are, or more likely; They weren\u2019t as knowledgeable about it. \n\nAs we all know, the Crucible became the Erdtree. The old world became the modern world. In that way, Ancestral Followers could be compared to Amish people, but in a more extreme way. \n\nAs the Amish folk do not live with electricity, the Ancestral Followers did not believe in using letters, or using metal. They rejected the new and chose to live secluded underground, still clinging on to the old ways. \u201cThe ancestral followers keep their distance from the Erdtree, awaiting new buds. They are certain to sprout from their very flesh, and indeed, their souls.\u201d\n\nThere is clearly a physical connection between the Hornsent and the Ancestral Followers, but the connection goes beyond the physical realm.\n\nGhostflame was a huge deal during the early days of the Hornsents age of the Crucible. It was one of many accepted forms of death, and it\u2019s the only one important for this theory. \n\nGhostflame is exactly what it sounds likes, a magic/spirit fire. It\u2019s also referred to as \u201cspirit flame\u201d and does magic damage instead of fire.\n\nThe Ancestral Followers also use magic/spirit fire that they call \u201cspirit vapor.\u201d Using the skull of a young ancestral spirit, they spew forth a blue vapor that deals magic damage, but exists in the physical form of fire. \n\nGiven all of the evidence, I believe that the Ancestral Followers are the progenitor species of  the Rauh, and therefore the Hornsent. And I believe Elden John may be the gap between the Ancestral Followers and the Rauh civilization. If you\u2019ve seen Elden John in his full glory, you would see that he\u2019s not quite a human. https://imgur.com/a/gg54W29\n\nElden John is clearly part tree, and I think that\u2019s what made him so important. I believe he may have been an ancient Empyrean. \"Verdigris is said to be the gift of an outer god.\u201d What this tells us, is that the Rauh civilization was at a turning point, and the Outer Gods were helping them make that turn. \n\nThey refused to use metal work and advanced language, but needed to use them to get to the next level of technology, consciousness, and magical ability. Essentially their own beliefs were holding them back from the next step in their cultural evolution. \u201cA spirit of the horned folk who eschew letters and metalworking.\u201d \n\nWe know Outer Gods use Empyreans to create Gods, to spread their message and influence. People certainly aren\u2019t out here making hundreds of giant stone statues of somebody that isn\u2019t a god, and given how massive the civilization became, I\u2019d say they were successful. \n\nWhat Elden John represents is the evolution of Mysticism into Paganism. Elden John is kinda being compared to Moses with his stone tablet, marking the beginning of a new age of spirituality. \n\nThe Ancestral Followers are the people of the Rauh civilization that rejected change. Like I said, they are an extreme example of the Amish. They chose the old world. They kept their brutish forms, and their indigenous lifestyle, because the new world went against their spiritual beliefs.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to show us that these Ancestral Followers are directly connected to the Rauh civilization, but there is enough. First is the most obvious, you really only find them in Rauh ruins. \n\nThe second, and real reason, is that interacting with the architecture is an important part of their religious rituals. The fires of each pillar must be lit in order to awaken the Ancestral Spirit. These pillars exist in all Rauh like ruins, so this isn\u2019t new construction the ancestral followers added in: https://imgur.com/a/c92Yb42\n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, we can get to the good part.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the connection between the Hornsent and Ancestral Followers, but what if I told you that this connection leads to the answers of a much deeper mystery? It answers the question of why the Nox and the Hornsent are connected. \n\nAt some point during the Ancestral Followers time in isolation, they were greeted by unexpected refugees from the surface. The Nox. \n\nI imagine the first meeting went something like this: \n\n\u201cSo you guys just like, chose to live down here this whole time huh? Not really my first choice, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers am I right ahahaha\u201d The Noxman looked back at his fellow peoples who were also engaged in snide laughter, and went for a few fist bumps. \n\nThe Ancestral Follower looked around at the ruined civilization, and remembered a day when they were once a great people. It\u2019s said that this Ancestral Follower would later go on to lead a march out of the underground. \n\nOk enough with my nonsense let\u2019s get back to real lore. \n\nI think it\u2019s pretty obvious that the Nox and the Ancestral Followers were in contact. It\u2019s impossible to get to certain Nox cities without going through Ancestral territory. And we even see the Nox using Rauh gravestones: https://imgur.com/a/UsBwWhp\n\nSo with that said, the similarities between Nox civilization and Hornsent civilization is incredibly striking. Let\u2019s explore some of those similarities. \n\nFirst the architecture: https://imgur.com/a/LIdW2WL\n\nUnderground Nox cities and Enir-Ilim are the only places that have this style. There\u2019s nowhere else above ground besides Enir-Ilim that are built this way.\n\nSecond, the symbols they use in their artwork, while unique to their own civilizations, is ultimately extremely similar: https://imgur.com/a/LBZIsYZ\n\nWhile it is a stretch to say these civilizations have the same artwork, there is still clearly some huge similarities here. \n\nThird, they both have similarly sized giant people: https://imgur.com/a/UrFBXlW\n\nThere\u2019s no other civilizations that have these random giant people, outside of literal giants. Just the Nox and the Hornsent.\n\nFourth, both civilizations turned massive amounts of people into stone: https://imgur.com/a/WwGwUeo\n\nThis one kinda speaks for itself. The only other place like you find bodies like this is Rykards arena, mixed in with the bodies of snakes. \n\nLast but not least, the fifth similarity between the two civilizations is their obsession with creating artificial life to reach divinity. \n\nThe Nox have had many experiments with trying to create divinity. The silver tears, albinaurics, dragon kin etc.\n\nThe Hornsents ancestors in Rauh were more into the whole artificial life thing than they were, but the Hornsent would do some experimenting of their own with the creation of the living jars. \n\nDespite all of these similarities between the Nox and the Hornsent, their religions and cultures were totally different from one another.\n\nWhile the Nox wanted to bring about the age of stars, the Hornsent were more than content with maintaining their own status quo. \n\nDespite all of these similarities, the only link we have between these 2 civilizations that could explain the strange connection, is the Ancestral Followers presence. \n\nPerhaps there were truths within that ancient mysticism that could only be understood by a more advanced society. Truths that the Hornsent would discover through many generations of an evolving religion, and the highly intelligent Nox would discover through their exposure to this strange people. \n\nSo what do you think? Did the Hornsent really descend from the Ancestral Followers, or is it all just a coincidence?",

As is apparent from the nature of \u201cdestined\u201d death and the dialogue provided by his wet nurse. While Ranni\u2019s actions in stealing half of his death for herself are labeled as a perversion of the natural order by the fingers, this is the **judgement** of the fingers alone. \n\nMuch of this crisis stems from the fingers role as a didactic for matters of fate which it only interprets. The fingers could determine that Godwin would die, yet it didn\u2019t correctly ordain the nuance of how, an nonetheless its rulings became a revered prophesy. So when Godwin died a half death (which paradoxically was thereafter always the correct corse of history, despite the fingers ruling), it\u2019s possible it became a crisis of legitimacy for the fingers. \n\n**If Godwins fate was destined, then it\u2019s by rule of paradox impossible that what occurred  subverted destiny.** \n\nThe root of the issue is, as we learn later, the fingers being a has-been fortune teller.

The suggestion that Ranni could be an empyrean capable of ordaining fate **independently** of the fingers; a suggestion seemingly endorsed by her foresight into the players actions an the possibility that they would chose to be her consort, is likely an existential threat to the aging fingers. \n\nBasically, the feud is about job security.

If that is the case that means that they've been around for a LOOOOOOOOONG time, and if so that means that they no doubt would have some at least extant connections to the Godskins.\n\nLo and behold there exists an item which might explain the nature of the Gods in question.\n\n\"Thin strips of flesh taken from a bloodless creature.\"\n~ Strips of White Flesh\n\nThis item specifically is dropped by the Oracle Envoys who themselves seem to have a quite ivory palor. \n\nSo essentially what does that tell us?

To me this indicates that these Gods may have had origins that lay in the water.\n\nAnother vein of thought that supports this is the mention of an alternative evolutionary process mentioned in the Godskin gear:\n\n\"Nobles are the most ancient apostles\nwho are said to have assimilated inhuman physiology.\"\n~ Godskin Noble Robe\n\nThe assimilation of inhuman physiology is what grabs me here. It might even imply that the Gods they hunted evolved based off an alternative to the Crucible, and the Crucibles creation may have been a more recent occurrence. This is also supported considering that the Godskins were known for borrowing other things from the Gods they hunted as well:\n\n\"Once a sign of the gods' wrath, this incantation became a trophy of the Nobles' god hunt.\"\n~ Noble Presence\n\nIt's quite possible that the Godskins white skin itself came about as a result of their hunt.\n\nI'd love to know everyone's thoughts!

But after the revelations of the DLC and multiple runs and time to reflect and analyse i believe i reached a conclusion.\n\nI personally believe that elden ring is a story about Marika's introspection post grief, done through the lens of extention of grace to tarnished that echo aspects of her and her history. Letting them compete to find the best solution forward in shadow of the failure of the golden order.\n\nAgreeing on motive :\n\nThe trailer for the game's story narrated by Ranni paints a simple and pretty clear picture of the events leading to the shattering. There is a sea of theories about wether Marika was in on the plan, wasn't, wanted to kill Godwyn to ready him for godhood but ranni fiddled with the black knives, some even stipulate Godwyn was cursed even before his death... Quite frankly none of it matters in the context of this discussion, as Ranni herself, the self proclaimed architect of the death of Godwyn, with her magical fingerprints all over the blade as confirmed by Rogier, says in that trailer that the death of Godwyn, and his incomplete state drove Marika to the brink which led to the shattering and later on the extention of grace to the tarnished.\n\nThe shattering and the summoning of the mending rune tarnished can be therefore understood as an attempt from Marika to see the world from an external perspective, retrace her path and relearn the world, herself and the order post grief seeing that every tarnished introduced in the cutscene has aspects of her and her history within them, and hopefully find a path forward.\n\nHorah loux is her first husband and ruler of the age of plenty, Fia is a reviled witch that engages in life giving and a deep desire for motherhood, Goldmask as an introspective sage seeking the depths of the order, dung eater as a walking talking manifestation of the terror inflicted upon her by the hornsent and inflicted by her upon them and Gideon as a knowledge seeker from without, not within.\n\nBeginning with Fia, as she represents the earliest stage of life of Marika as a shaman girl, reviled and hunted down by the dominant culture, and the idea of the divine feminine. Both Marika and Fia have deep ties to the concept of motherhood, absorbing life to give life, sending heroes to do their bidding and having their headquarters be bedchambers with stacks of books next to them. \n\nMesopotamia and the divine feminin : \n\nElden ring takes inspiration from world history and mythology but nowhere is it clearer than with the hornsent, godfrey and Marika.\n\nEnir illim clearly is inspired by bab illim or Babylon in English. Midra's wife Nanaya is named after a fertility godess and speculated aspect of Ishtar/Inanna. Godfrey's history even has many similarities to the story of Gilgamesh, an ancient warrior king always depicted with a lion as his greatest friend. But it appears the roles were flipped as the regal king is Serosh and the barbarian beast is Horah loux, in the story of Gilgamesh Enkidu lives as one with the beasts naked similar to Horah loux, the highlanders and the badlanders and shunning exess adornment to hunt bears and beasts to be filled with the extacy of the wild.\n\nIn that story, Enkidu terrorises the hunters and the animals until a priestess of Ishtar names Shamhat literally, and without any exaggeration screws him into submission for seven days and seven nights straight. In many ancient cultures masculinity is seen as explosive, wild, tumultuous and destructive. But with the introduction of feminity and the transformative capabilities of it, through sexual intercourse that negative energy is not only removed but transformed into life and a gateway for civilization through the stifling of beastly urges clearing the mind. These prostitutes even engaged in ritualistic intercourse to bless harvests. Of course Enkidu later hears about Gilgamesh and fights him to the near death and from that is born the first bromance in recorded history. Add to that Gilgamesh was fond of axes as weapons, being his and Enkidu's weapon of choice against the divine beast humbaba that lived in a forest of ancient trees.\n\nThis act fits the depiction of the hornsent grandam of Marika as a wanton strumpet and the first sin as a seduction and then a betrayal through the banishment of Godfrey.\n\nFia herself is very coded as a ritualistic prostitute and divine mother gathering life from champions to give a noble a second life, done through flesh and please don't tell me i'm the only one that sees this, there was a thousand ways Miyazaki could depict a baldachin but he chose the one with a clit and curtains.\n\nThe tarnished can be seen here a second Godfrey serving the role of being the father of Godwyn's second life. Like Godfrey was to his first life. \n\nMarika, through the guidance of grace offered to Fia and offered to the tarnished leading towards Fia accepts death, those who live in death and Godwyn within her as the symbolic pillar of the principle of life within death in the golden order and a renewed love for motherhood. Fia even declares the tarnished her greatest champion giving him her radiant blessing and that being a deathbed companion was her greatest joy.\n\nThis is a repost and a light revision to a removed post, the second is Goldmask and the third will be the dung eater. Gonna be morbid as hell and possibly longer, oof.",

Some of their attacks appear to do holy damage as well, although I'm not certain of that.\n\nThe expedition description reads:\n\n\"Seven valkyries clad in white armor. These servants of the heavens restore the balance of the world by wielding heroic weapons that purify chaos.\n\nBut even heroines must one day sleep, so why not retire early to the annals of history?\"\n\n  \nThe use of weapons, of course, typically involves death, even when it's for a noble cause. I know that \"of the heavens\" could set them apart from the concept of \"death's gentle envoys\", but I would like to point out that Maliketh's Black Blade (the weapon and the incantation), and the Black Knife weapons do holy damage, and things related to Black Flame scale on Faith.\n\nAnd the description in the relic received for defeating them reads:\n\n&gt;!A tiny farming village was besieged by bandits, who proceeded to ravage both its plots and people.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!A young village girl, seeking help, dashed into the forest, where she prayed to the statue of a protective deity that held a weapon raised overhead.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!By the end the village was steeped in red and settled in silence. The village girl, drenched in blood, stood with a vacant stare and a heroic weapon in her grip.!&lt;\n\nThe mention of &gt;!\"a protective deity that held a weapon raised overhead\"!&lt; doesn't sound like any statues we've seen of Marika, and could potentially fall under the category of \"pagan beliefs\" in the Lands Between. Radagon does strike a pose like this in the intro to his boss fight, but not in his statues.\n\n  \nI understand that the nature of Nightreign's canon is shaky, but the Winged Scythe's description has always felt like a bit of an odd inclusion in Elden Ring, and this kind of lore expansion seems like a perfect fit for Nightreign. The game's director has more or less said directly that it's designed to exist in Elden Ring's world without unraveling its central plot and mysteries. I'm curious what others think though.",

The Cleanrot Knights have white wings on their helm, and Miquella and Malenia have many ties to ancient death culture.

The Spectral Rings of Light of course look like a prototype of Miquella\u2019s light with their age being quite apparently older than Miquella\u2019s Unalloyed.

    "body": "The Maiden featured on the Shield of the Guilty seems to reveal a bit about the nature of the Lands Between and it's existence as a possible Penal Colony.\n\nThe shield description reads...\n\n\"Shield made to venerate a maiden whose eyes were crushed by Briars of Sin before being reborn in these lands.\n\nVenerating the repose of the soul, this shield boosts focus. The briars can be used to attack foes.\"\n\nRight away we are given several subjects...\n\n- The Briars of Sin\n- Rebirth\n- Repose of the Soul\n\nWhat does this tell us? Well essentially it seems that the Briar Maiden was guilty of something as Briars of Sin reveals:\n\n\"The guilty, their eyes gouged by thorns, lived in eternal darkness. There, they discovered the blood star.\"\n\nThis tells us right away that the Briar Maiden was guilty of something. For this she had her eyes crushed by deadly briars and was forced to walk in Eternal Darkness for her punishment. \n\nThe presence of Briars also possibly implies a strong connection to the Blood Star, and by possible extension the Mother of Truth.\n\nAside from her these thorns are featured on the Fire Guardian Hags likely signifying some connection between these two parties. In essence it begs the question of what are these hags guilty of if they are in-service to the Erdtree. A service that would ensure the trees longevity at that.\n\nAnother possessor of Briars is Elemer, another foreigner who himself was set to be Executed if it weren't for the downfall of House Marais. His gear reads:\n\n\"Battered iron armor from a foreign land. Worn by Elemer of the Briar. \n\nThe winding, rusted iron briars are a mark of the guilty and typically indicate a sentence of death.\n\nElemer murdered numerous instructors and merchants, and was known as the Bell Bearing Hunter.\"\n\n~ Briar Armor\n\nAgain we are given the subjects of Guilt and foreign nature. Elemer originates from Eochaid and for whatever reason he was sent ALL THE WAY to TLB to be killed. Why? \n\nThat brings us to our next subjects: Rebirth and Repose of the Soul.\n\nWhy The Lands Between, ignoring differences between real world and fictional economies, wouldn't it cost less to just kill them where they were? Perhaps but what if I told you that they were only meant to die to be reborn. If we take another look at the Shield of the Guilty it mentions:\n\n\"Shield made to venerate a maiden whose eyes were crushed by Briars of Sin before being reborn in these lands.\"\n\nTo be reborn requires that one must have died, even in the metaphorical sense, something must be given up to gain new shape. And it's not like this isn't something that happens regularly in TLB anyways:\n\n\"Amber egg clutched by Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon.\nGreat Rune of unborn demigods.\n\nPerfects those who have been born anew.\n\nChildren born anew by Rennala are all frail and short-lived. Imperfect beings, each and all.\"\n\nIn fact we see a myriad of enemies in game that have seemingly been reborn into new shapes, and each of them drops a Larval Tear. In order for this rebirth to be reversed the creatures new form in question must be destroyed to revert. This loosely connects Death with transformation (though then again it could just be a gameplay mech who knows?)\n\nBut lastly to tie this together are the Lulling Branch and the Slumbering Egg:\n\n\"In the midst of drowsiness, there is the will to awaken.\nFeelings that rise from the depths of one's heart.\"\n\n\"Owl eggs that will never hatch.\nMaterial used for crafting items.\n\nPrized as a symbol of the most sublime slumber.\"\n\nIn previous posts I detail how Sleep the domain of St. Trina has intrinsic connections to Death which is countered by Miquella's connection to \"waking,\" birth or what we collectively reference as Nascency.\n\nBoth operate as vital parts of the cycle of rebirth one bringing rest to that which whithers, while the other rouses new life into birth.\n\nThe line mentioned on the shield:\n\n\"Venerating the repose of the soul\"\n\nSeems to be referencing directly the subject mentioned prior in the same item: the concept of being reborn.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nI have come to believe that The Lands Between are indeed a Penal Colony, and that Death only washes ashore to be reborn in some way into a more suitable acceptable form. This would even seem to explain the Zealotry of the Hornsent who Jar the Maidens.\n\nIf indeed there was some history here wherein the Shaman would, \"Make Saints of Criminals\" who came there, we can kinda see how it could turn for the worst if perhaps a previous order had been deposed.\n\nTo put it concisely: The Shaman were likely Wardens of a Penal Colony, and could have suffered a disaster which tilted the scales out of their favor making the prison (rehabilitation center?) they once held into cage for themselves. \n\nTo back this up I'll even bring up the Winged Scythe:\n\n\"According to pagan belief, white-winged maidens are said to be Death's gentle envoys.\"\n\nThe Deathbirds were no doubt Matriarchal given that their only progenitor given was a Mother in the Form of the Twinbirds. And here we are again given the concept of femininity in connection with Death. The Deathbed companions, Trina, Melina, Ranni and even Malenia and her Valkyries. \n\nThis paints a picture of a Matriarchal Land of Death and if one has Death, it must be tempered and defined by Life. The line connecting these two? Rebirth. \n\nBonus bit:\n\nThis got me to thinking also about the Biblical Story of Cain and Abel. To keep it short, after Cain kills his Brother he is sent to \"The Land of Nod,\" and if one where to look up the meaning of the word Numen/Numina:\n\n\"Etymologically, the word means \"a nod of the head\", here referring to a deity as it were \"nodding\", or making its will or its presence known.\"\n\nJust some food for thought. I hope you enjoyed my ramblings, please lmk what you think! And as always HAPPY LORE HUNTING!!!",

Most people just accept that at face value, believing that Shabriri is, as he himself claims to be, chaos incarnate and using that as an excuse to not have to explain any of the things he does or says because \"he's chaotic\" but this line of thinking has never sat right with me. For one thing villains never start out as villains, certainly not in these games. There is no character in any one of these games that is pure evil, so it's crazy to me that everyone would just accept the idea that Shabriri is and has always been pure evil simply because he's supposed to be chaotic, or that he's always been the same person that he is when we meet him in-game even before he had his eyes gouged out.\n\nThe most common theory I've heard is that Shabriri slandered the wandering merchants, claiming that they worshipped the three fingers and flame of frenzy (this is the theory in Vaati's frenzy vid)\n\nbut 1. this couldn't be the case if the frenzy's presence in the Lands Between started with Shabriri. It's specifically stated that \"the sickness of the flame of frenzy began with Shabriri\" (Howl of Shabriri).\n\nand 2. the wandering merchants WERE imprisoned for this very crime, so if Shabriri's lie was proven to be false, then why were the merchants imprisoned anyway? Why would he be punished for slander if the golden order believed him and imprisoned the merchants, and if you wanna say that it was proven to be false after they had already been imprisoned then why weren't they released? it just doesn't make sense.\n\nIt's just never made sense to me that Shabriri told a damaging lie, was punished for it, and that was the event that caused the flame of frenzy, the outer god embodying the very concept of madness and chaos, to dwell within him. Why would the maddening flame of frenzy have originated from that of all things? If Shabriri had told a horrible lie and was punished for it, that's not maddening, that's just. Sure, the punishment probably doesn't fit the crime but still, he did something bad and was punished for it. It's always been my belief that the real reason it would have driven Shabriri to madness is because it wasn't a lie. For once he was telling the truth and nobody believed him. That's enough to drive anyone mad.\n\nI've always read it as a boy who cried wolf kind of scenario. Shabriri was a liar and reviled by all in his community for it, but one day he discovered some horrible truth about some well-respected figure, someone with power and influence, maybe in the world or just in his community. He tried to expose this person, but of course, Shabriri was already reviled by this point. He was known by all to be a liar and so, nobody believed him even though this time he really was telling the truth. As to who he accused, we can never really know, but it had to have been someone with a lot of influence for Shabriri's eyes to have been gouged out. If you're familiar with One Piece, you could compare his story to Usopp's story in Syrup Village. Every day Usopp would run through town claiming pirates were coming to raid the town, so the one day pirates did actually show up, and the one leading them was a respected figure of that town's community, nobody believed him.\n\nIdk if anyone else shares this line of thinking, I've only seen the more popular theories which all hinge on the fact that he was indeed telling a lie. i'd like to hear what other people think",

    "body": "In a previous post I discussed in depth that in my opinion, the shattering done by Marika was an act of trying to figure out the future of the world and deal with the grief of Godwyn's death and the failure of the order. \n\nI explained how extending grace to the mending rune bearing tarnished, gideon and Godfrey are an attempt from Marika to explore the order through an external perspective as they all share multiple aspects of her and call back to multiple parts of her life. Fia as a reviled opressed life giver and mother, Goldmask as the seeker of knowledge and exploration of the depths of the order, The dung eater as a walking talking manifestation of the karmic dept, curses, trauma and hatred inflicted upon her by the hornsent and inflicted onto the hornsent in vengeance.\n\nThis post will focus on Goldmask, Metyr, Midra, Gideon and Radagon as a lot of people believe Goldmask's ending and mending rune to either be the best option or simply an eternal, unmodifiable return to the status quo, or believe everything he achieves in the game is nothing but nonsense ever since the reveals that the fingers that guided Marika were not communicating with the greater will but with the unhinged Metyr.\n\nMetyr and failure at motherhood : \n\nIf Hyetta and Ymir are to be believed, and I find no reason why they shouldn't in this case as they use different methods of communing with an outer god and study of the stars to reach the same conclusion, the world itself was born of the rapture of the one great, something Hyetta calls a mistake as it allowed for the creation of every life, every sin and every curse without hope for change. As in the elden ring world the two principles of the golden order observed through exploration of the depths of the ring are causality and regression. The principle of causality dictates every action has a reaction, meaning it is literally impossible to make an action not based on precedent reactions and for the future not to be affected by the actions of the present, this principle echoes the concept of original sin in Christianity and Karma in Buddhism. In that sense, the karmic dept of the world can become so severe that despair and frenzy become the only options. The greater will ruptures, abandons Metyr, who abandons her fingers, who abandon Marika, who abandons her children, who abandon the realm. The twin bird abandons the death birds. The dragon god abandons the ancient dragons. Rennala abandons Caria and her children... Existence in elden ring in this case is fundamentally incomplete and eternally looking at the mother for blame, curses and validation. No only that, but in their foolishness they yearn for motherhood in hope of being the mother they never had and giving birth to complete creatures. This is best told by the game through Ymir and Yuri and Ymir takes every tragedy and sin in the world and puts the blame wholly on the mother, bragging and hoping he is capable of replacing Metyr and birthing Yuri whole as a way to cope with the trauma of losing his child, but all he makes is more finger creepers, incomplete. His use of motherhood as a coping mechanism is also exemplified through his abuse of the sisters of night, as he wishes to be the only star, the only mother, the only beloved and the only source of love even if this involves locking away all evidence of one sister being turned into a puppet from the other and grooming them from childhood to be his swordhands raised in perpetual darkness that only he can illuminate.\n\nRadagon, is characterised by the game as constantly seeking completeness, meaning he is incomplete himself. His search for completeness  is shown in the game primarily through cultivation of knowledge and faith through his two unions and alchemically he serves as the symbolic king of the sun, the masculine half of the rebis. (This is medieval spiritual alchemy so we're about to get sexist but not really.) The king of the sun embodies masculinity as a spiritual concept inherently recognised, cultivated and curated by both the action and reactions of men and women. Defining what a man is, should be, shouldn't be, will do but shouldn't, won't do but should at all stages of life, this isn't one state of dos and don't for example a barbarian, a well manner gentleman and a sage are considered masculine in different ways and a woman embodiying these things does not stop them from being masculine... Order, gold, fire, sun, virile, lion, wise... Are all described in the great work as aspects of Masculinity that are to be integrated with the feminine to become complete. Yet, even during his age, Radagon is not the archetype of the masculine in the lands between, it's Godfrey. Ever since antiquity in the lands between it was Horah loux or Godfrey that defined the soul of what a man is, despite his banishment, the ruin of his lineage and his replacement by a much recent lord, the lands between ooses his influence and very print after centuries. The hornsent built their armor modeling naked form and wear lions as helms, the beast regent of farum azula is on his shoulders, the corpses of giants litter the mountaintops, the kaiden still roam limgrave upholding strength based fighting and subjugation of beasts through horse riding, the crucible knights he led still roam the lands, sword monuments stand to his defeated enemies, the colosseums still stand, the tarnished warriors of his are the last hope the lands between and even the fighting techniques he uses are used not only by badland warriors but also rank and file messmer soldiers, crucible knights and horned warriors. Even Radagon's own children have to look past his fundamentalism to grow and flourish as people, Rykard defies the order itself through the serpent embodying a perversion of Godfrey's will in the code of the recusants \"the strong take\", Radahn idolises Godfrey and his red hair (the part he hated about himself) and revived the traditions of martial might and colosseum lion fighting through the redmanes. Ranni follows the path shown by her mother and her mentor, Miquella gives up on fundamentalism as it failed his sister, Malenia finds guidance through the warrior that followed the old ways and taught her to mimic a bird dancing on water to fight the rot and when defeated echoes Godfrey's spirit in accepting defeat and admitting that your strength warrants the crown of a true lord, Melina explores the world and the order and concludes death is necessary and messmer locks himself in a room forever in grief if his abandonment by Marika without even paying him attention. Radagon spends his life gathering knowledge from Rennala and leaves her the instant he thinks he learned enough, even descrating the symbol of their union as a show of vanity. And when his order breaks he desperately tries to keep it together and locks himself and Marika away.\n\nThe spirit of Radagon lives thus through one man alone, Gideon Ofnir. A hunched over old man that spent his life gathering knowledge without wisdom, has no moral standing, lets others do his bidding and when he is faced with a dillema is immediately paralyzed in fear and gives up on his life goal, incapable of dealing with the state of aporia his revelations granted him. Not willing to intellectually wrestle and fight for his wanted position as elden lord and reaching a state of euporia. Nepheli, his adopted daughter's salvation even lies in abandoning him for a reaffirming of her identity as blood of Godfrey and seeking guidance from the stormhawk king as per the old ways and becoming lord of Limgrave as her ancestor did, her only other path is servitude as the puppet of a deviant. His counterpart in the DLC, sir Ansbach is ten thousand times more deserving of his monicker but his humility will never allow him to wear it, carries himself as a respected warrior honored and feared even by his enemies and accepts your lordship attained by defeating Mohg in an honorable duel as dictated by Godfrey.\n\nRadagon is thus ideologically obsolete and his seed is rotten, when viewed through this lens he is a failure at every level, never achieved completeness despite his godhood.\n\nGoldmask the complete : \n\nGoldmask represents intellectual completeness in elden ring through his form and existence, he communicates through movements of his fingers yet he is not seeking the guidance of a mother, brother Corhyn even affirms what he is doing is self reflection and calculus, symbolically meaning he is more complete than any two fingers. His DLC counterpart, sage Midra, is a dark reflection of him that after rigorous torture came to embrace the enlightenment of chaos given by the frame of frenzy, the opposite force to the golden order. While Midra carries that enlightenment as a ball of yellow fire on his shoulders, Goldmask carries it through his mask, symbol of his mastery over the secrets of Order itself. Their weakness is their physical feeblness, denying them the title of lord.\n\nGoldmask unlike what a lot of people think, stands in opposition to the golden order at it is. Going through rigorous questionning of the order, fighting through the aporia in order to reach the totality of the golden order. Goldmask is against the death hunters as he sees that a perfect order does not contain an evil for the good and the great to contend with, during his reflection on the order, when faced with the idea that Radagon is Marika he does not collapse or give up but simply keeps going, in the mountaintops he even commits to recognising the burning of the tree and the reintroduction of destined death into the golden order is absolutely necessary much to the confusion and fear of brother Corhyn. And it's not a coincidence that the rune he discovers is found on his corpse that still holds the pose of golden order totality, meaning an acceptance of death as part of the golden order. The rune was already there, he just found it through reflection and calculus, showing his level of deep wisdom surpassing Radagon and Gideon who give up the instant they are challenged by reality. \n\nAs the conclusion of Goldmask is that the golden order is possible and achieveable through removing the fickleness of the gods, the reintroduced destined death and the rejection of absolute evil and the affirmation of the game as his status of sage severing the dependance on a mother and finding completeness through embodying a finger that doesn't seek answers from outside. The golden order perfected by Goldmask is literally impossible to be the same thing as Radagon's as not only does it come from a more reflective perspective but it very clearly embraces aspects shunned by the order.\n\nNext is the dung eater, guilt, curses, cycles of violence and the karmic debt of Marika and the hornsent.\n\nOof this is long as hell.\n",

Both, the flower/tree and the statues depict surrounding trunks bearing flowers with a central trunk reaching up. In the case of the of the flower/tree, the central trunk is composed of two spiraling trunks while in the statue, a burned figure is helping a single trunk to be the central one, this trunk bearing a central golden flower. \n\nTheory time:\nAs some reliefs on Enir Illim and the Scadutree can indicate, the original form of the divine tree should have been a spiral. We know that this didn't come to pass, Marika ensured that light(gold) and darkess(shadow) remained separated in a physical and metaphysical way (even the lands of gold and the shadow realm are separated). But if the natural way is a spiral, how did Marika managed this? The burned statue holding the golden flower is the answer: the first burning of the Erdtree. As everyone knows, Leyndel is covered in ash, pointing to this happening in the past. But why? Well, why do we burn the Erdtree? To usher a new age. All the game endings need the Erdtree to be burnt for us to usher a new age, with the Erdtree changing in the process. That's why the burned figure is depicted helping the golden flower rise amongst the crucible, this statue is depicting the kindling maiden that ended the age of the crucible and enabled the age of the Erdtree. And yes, I think that the statue is depicting Melina before she was burned and bodiless. The godhunt could have been a way to purge Marika's lineage from her less than desirable descendants and Melina could have been playing her role, just as her older brother, Messmer. Messmer burned the hornsent following her mothers orders but other descriptions say that he escaped from the capital. Messmer was used as a cover up for Marikas true intentions and I think that Melina suffered the same fate. The tree had to be burned and  some demigods had to die but Marika couldn't be related to this so, as Messmer did, Melina was asked to take the fall.  ",

In that item description, where the English says \u201cthis spear, modelled on its crucible\u201d the Japanese says modelled on that \u2018crucible-like state\u2019. The kanji used for state is \u6a23, and when I researched that kanji, turns out that in Chinese, while the main meaning is still form/state/appearance, it\u2019s also in some historical Chinese dictionaries as an alternative glyph for \u6a61, which means Oak or acorn. So there are two readings, crucible-like state and crucible-like oak. Obviously Siluria\u2019s tree looks like\u2026 a tree, and the roots we see around the deeproot depths, the ones which are pale and clearly distinguishable from the Erdtree roots (which are a different colour and size) are most likely Oak tree roots based on their appearance. Siluria is even standing by one of these Oak roots. So there was an Oak tree which was super important to these Crucible knights. Was it the crucible itself, or just a related thing?\n\nAnother interesting link this creates is that the Haligtree sheds red Oak leaves, and the Scadutree chalice contains the same red Oak leaves. Elphael and the Shadow Keep have similar architecture too. I have my own ideas on what this all implies, but I\u2019ll just leave it here for you to incorporate into your own.",

She wielded the power of flame (like her brother messmer) and infused it with the power of destined death to create her weapon she could use to defeat her mother. The Godslaying Black Flame. (This also tracks with how each of the Demigods claimed a great rune from the Elden Ring. The \u201cGreat Rune\u201d of the Gloam Eyed Queen was the Rune of Death) \n\nUltimately Melina met her end as the Gloam Eyed Queen when she was defeated by Maliketh of the Black Blade, Marikas shadow. (This also would give further cause for why the Demigods all feared Maliketh) \n\nHowever, even though Maliketh killed her she did not die, because upon her defeat her mother Queen Marika removed the rune of death from the Elden Ring. And Maliketh then sealed the rune inside his blade. Thus her body died but yet she lives burned and bodiless. ( My own theory is that at this time she remained dormant in the form of a rememberance)\n\nFast forward to the shattering. Marika is now held captive inside the Erdtree by the Greater Will as punishment for shattering the Elden Ring.\n\nMarika knows that only \u201cones who envision Flame\u201d have the power to burn the erdtree and thus gain access to where she is. (As confirmed by Finger Reader Enia)\n\nFrom inside the Erdtree she uses the remembrance of the Gloam Eyed Queen her daughter, to resurrect her as Melina. And tasks her with the role of serving as the Kindling Maiden and aiding the tarnished who would be Lord. \n\n(I think it also might be possible to say she is a special type of spirit ash summon that Marika created from the Gloam Eyed Queen remains)\n\nFast forward to Frenzied Flame ending. Now that the Rune of death has been unsealed by the Tarnished. Her power she wielded as the Gloam Eyed Queen has now also been unsealed as well. \nAnd we see her transformed.\n\nThe reason Melina eye was always closed before was because it held a remnant of the power of destined death. The mark over her eye I believe represented a shard of the Rune of Death. \n\nNow the rune of death is unleashed and the power of Destined death that was sealed in her eye (or perhaps the ability to control Destined Death) has been unleashed with it.\n\nThus the Gloam Eyed Queen is reborn. \n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Ah, this ties into one of my oldest ideas/theories. The largest number of frenzy trolls appears at the Yelough Anix ruins. I think that\u2019s a cheeky spelling of Yellow Anise ruins. It refers to the Star Anise plant, which has a fruit that resembles a star. The biggest stumbling block in my theory is that the fruit usually has 6 follicles, not 5 like what\u2019s depicted here. But I still believe that could be a deliberate change to make a fantasy version of the plant which better fits the cosmology of the setting. Anyway, the most well known Star Anise is the Chinese star anise, which is a popular spice. But theres also a very similar species, the Japanese star anise, which is extremely toxic. There have been known mix ups where Japanese star anise has gotten into a batch of Chinese star anise and caused very severe food poisoning cases.\n\nThe Latin names of the two plants are \u201cIllicium verum\u201d (which means seduce and genuine) for the Chinese one, and \u201cIllicium anisatum\u201d (which means seduce and anise-scented) for the Japanese one. Although it\u2019s toxic for consumption, the Japanese star anise does still get used as an incense in certain Buddhist rituals as it\u2019s apparently good at warding away spirits, who don\u2019t like it.\n\nSo taking this all together, my theory was that this is symbolic of the relationship between Gold and Frenzy. Gold is the genuine article, and is nourishing and healthy. Frenzy has a similar appearance, and is even described as seductive, but is a fake, with multiple examples of items that imitate helpful gold based ones but are actually harmful. Also, burning the frenzy plant creates an effect which harms spirits.\n\nAs Rennalla also has the pattern, the star anise links into the worship of the stars. The stars could be a heavenly equivalent of the anise plants, with the meteors/fallingstars being the seeds. Thus, the yellow meteor at the bottom of the tunnel may contain Frenzy, and was mistakenly mined by those thinking it would contain golden amber like other meteors that have been mined. The presence of an Astel hints that this is a very very old site, as it would have grown as a fallingstar beast and gone through its entire growth cycle.\n\nI think there\u2019s potentially even bigger implications that draw out from this, but it involves getting into other stuff which isn\u2019t related here and is also a bit crackpot, so I\u2019ll leave this to stand on its own.",

In fact, the fact that St. Trina never received a Great Rune suggests she may not be regarded a demigod, either, which is strange to consider.\n\nAs far as we know, Ranni has no dual aspect. She has Blaidd, just as Marika has Maliketh, but Shadows are neither demigods nor Empyreans, despite having been created from some aspect of one. Malenia has no dual aspect nor shadow, and as for Melina and Messmer, it seems possible they could be cursed Empyreans like Miquella and Malenia owing to their singular god-parent.\n\nIf anything, someone else could have been an aspect of the GEQ, but that's if she *had* one...

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "So we know all the demigods and gods and Elden Ring experience a boost in height due to divinity. The demigods tower over most beings in the game. Even demigods such as Ranni are speculated to be eight feet tall when they had there empyrean flesh  and Miquella received growth burst when he uses the gate of divinity overcoming his curse of youth.\n\nOne can conclude that Divine Blood plays a role in ones height. The more one has divine blood in them the taller they can be.\n\nBut then there are outliers; Rennala, Rellana, Loretta, O'Neil, Godfrey, Loretta and Niall. Both exhibit heights that rival the demigods and gods. This includes Rennala herself being two feet taller then Marika and Radagon.\n\nSo divine blood clearly has its limits, that mortals can surpass. Now all the outliers have one two things in common; their all warriors/champions who fought in wars and their all old by real life standards.\n\nNow, it should be noted that there are other ancient figures that do not experience a height growth specifically the Carian Knights who are as old as Lorretta and remain Tarnish size.\n\nClearly age by itself does not effect the height but what about the other binding factor to the outliers; combat.\n\nWe only need to look to our own Tarnish who is capable of slaying many great champions and growing stronger but still witness no growth spurt.\n\nSo combat by itself is clearly not a factor for height in the Lands Between...\n\nBut What if  the factors of time and combat worked in tangent to contribute to height?\n\nI hypothesize a formula for height\n\n***Divine Blood + ( Time x Runes Gathered)= Height***\n\nLets plug this formula into certain characters to see if it matches out.\n\nThe greatest example of this is Radahn who in his star scourge form is one of the tallest humanoids in the Land Between.\n\nRadahn has the divine blood of Radagon/ Marika and he participated in allot of fights in the shattering which takes place over many years. All these factors would contribute to greater height for Radahn based on my proposed formula.\n\nNow lets take a look at our Tarnish and plug them into this formula. They have no divine blood so that factor would be zero. The Tarnishes journey from start to finish is pretty short compared to the history of the demigods and champions of the Lands Between  so the age factor would be a near zero as well. This leaves the runes gathered which is the only positive factor for the Tarnish but the effects of that requires more time to contribute to height.\n\nNow lets look at a demigod that that barely fights in the history of the Lands Between; Ranni before she became a doll.  It is speculated that Ranni's original height is around eight to nine feet tall. Now she does have some fights under her belt as seen with her besting Adula, but in order for it to count to the rune factor she has to kill and take the runes of those she defeat. So Ranni rune factor is near zero so no matter how old she gets she wont grow that much. Ranni does show the limits of  how much divine blood can impact height by itself. With one parent of divinity the height is eight to nine feet tall.\n\n\n\nNow lets look at a trickery example the Carian Knights. We only fight two in game one protecting Rennala and one protecting Rellana. Neither of them have divine blood so that factor would be zero. Their both pretty old so that factor would be high but despite being very good at combat they are only Tarnish size. Now remember what I said about Rannis combat factor being low because she didn't kill anyone directly. The Carian Knights were renown for their skills in combat but said skills might have been acquired through friendly spares with each other improving their blade work. Since no deaths occurred their rune factor would remain  near zero. When looking at the what the two Carian Knights are doing in game this makes perfect sense; their both body guards protecting the Carian Sisters, not warriors leading the charge against the enemies of Caria.\n\nCompare that to another Carian Knight who most likely played a more active role; Loretta. She has zero divine blood but probably participated in both Liurnian Wars allowing her to gain quite a bit of runes over time contributing to her height.\n\nSpeaking of Liurnian Wars we have Rennala, who participated in two wars against the Erd Tree.  She has no divine blood so that factor would be zero for her, but seeing how she was the champion of Liurnia and fought in two wars her rune count would be pretty high, enough to catch the eyes of Radagon.\n\nAnd one final example; Malenia. Her divine blood grants her a default height of eight feet tall but she is short despite being warrior. I believe similar to the Carian Knights, Malenia combat experience was built up over the years through friendly spares and training under her mentor that taught her to resist the scarlet rot.  Malenia is a empyrean too precious to lose in a war so she would most likely be forbidden from fighting against hostile forces while Marika was still active. Not to mention she was the protector of Miquella and acted as a body guard for him similar to that of the two Carian Knights in game who protect their lieges. Finally we have the cinematic where Radahn fights Malenia in which Malenia is forced to reattach her prosthetic arm mid fight something which foes less honorable then Radahn would take advantage of and use the opportunity to kill the child of Marika. I think these factors indicate that Malenia despite being one of the most skilled combatants in the Lands between has a low rune factor contributing to her height being way less then that of Radahn. So for Malenia she would only have divine blood working towards her height.\n\nIn conclusion I believe that height in Elden Ring is determine by the amount of divine blood in a individual and a  factor of runes that kicks in over time.",

There is a very clear throughline to Marika's ascension:\n\n1. Everybody has gold within them, and killing someone allows you to take their gold and get stronger.\n\n2.

    "body": "# Overview\n\nHere's what we know of the Carian Knights in general:\n\n* The Carian Knights (also referred to as \"Enchanted Knights\") were anointed by the Lunar Queen\n* They were all heroes of the highest honors, but fell into disarray with the decline of the royal family\n* They served as direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses\n* They were awarded the Carian Filigreed Crest, which is described as an \"honor\", reducing the burden of casting sorceries\n* They were gifted the Carian Glintblade Staff, rather than the Carian Glintstone Staff (which would enable Sorcerers to take on the role of an enchanted knight, likely in lieu of being able to wield both sorceries and swords)\n* They had sorceries bestowed upon them by the Carian Royal family. \"Human\" Carian Knights, for example, combined the Glintblade Phalanx with their swordsmanship to maintain pressure upon their foes, striking in waves of steel and sorcery.\n* Enchanted troll knights were \"the comrades of the young Rennala, bound by oath.\"\n* The Carian Knights are said to \"never waver\", with the \"Human\" Carian Knights leveraging the Lucidity sorcery to alleviate any onset of Sleep and Madness\n* The \"Human\" Carian Knights carried a shield said to excel when facing both magic or holy attacks, which points to enemies from both Liurnia (anticipating betrayal from the Academy, referenced in the \"Carian Retaliation\" sorcery) and Leyndell (Erdtree Sentinels, rather than Dragon Cultists, perhaps?)\n* These knights' swords could serve as catalysts, letting them wield sorcerous battle skills\n* They formerly used the Carian Sorcery Sword (said to be used by \"the Carian knights of old\") before the full refinement of their sorcerous combat techniques, as it functioned as a catalyst for glintstone sorcery when executing strong attacks. Note that the Weapon Skill for this sword is \"Impaling Thrust\", same as the \"Spear\" that was once used by the Enchanted Knight class in V1.00, though back then, that was known as the \"Winged Spear\" and used \"Charge Forth\" as the base weapon skill.\n* Despite numbering fewer than twenty, this power to wield sorcerous battle skills made them a match for even the champions of gold in battle\n* **Adding this point regarding Troll Knights because I forgot to when I first posted:** *Called into service when the Queen invoked an oath they swore,* *the trolls are treated as true knights of Caria, and fight arm in arm with their human comrades.*\n\nWhile we obviously can never really say whether it was a rule to only have fewer than twenty Carian Knights at any given time, as a broad statement, it begs the question: **how many can we realistically account for?**\n\n# \"Human\" Carian Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #1: Loretta**\n\n* **Quote:** \"Loretta was once a royal Carian Knight and her lapis-lazuli blue cape is the emblem of the knightly pride that continues to guide her\"\n* **Quote:** Undertook a \"long, bloody journey to seek out a place where the Albinaurics could live in peace\" and \"determined that the Haligtree was their best chance for eventual salvation.\"\n* **Quote:** \"It is said that the bow was Loretta's favored weapon.\"\n* **Quote:** Her war sickle is said to have originally \"been given for service as a personal guard to Carian royalty\"\n* **Observation:** She is now a Knight of the Haligtree, loyal to Miquella, with her war sickle's blue glintstone now replaced by unalloyed gold\n* **Observation:** Rumored to be an Albinauric, though the game's text decries this rumor as \"absurd\"\n\n**Carian Knight #2: Moongrum**\n\n* **Observation:** Guards the entrance of the elevator leading up to Rennala at the Raya Lucarian Academy\n* **Observation:** Wields a Carian Knight's Shield (with Carian Retaliation), a Carian Knight's Sword, uses an Academy Glintstone Staff to cast Carian Piercer.\n* **Observation:** The Carian Piercer is a counterpart to the Carian Greatsword sorcery, which itself is said to allow sorcerers to \"gain the strength of knights, their loyalty sworn to the moon.\"\n* **Theory:** While some theorize that Moongrum turned on Rellana and sided with the Academy, the Academy itself seems to be splintered and lacks leadership. My personal belief is that Moongrum is still loyal to Rennala and is found where he is because he's protecting her. His mostly Carian loadout is only contradicted by his choice of staff, which itself is still using a Carian sorcery; it's not a massive leap to guess that he entered the ranks of the Carian Knights when the Carian Royals and the Raya Lucarian Academy were allied.\n\n**Carian Knight #3: Moonrithyll**\n\n* **Observation:** Found at Castle Ensis, guarding the path ultimately leading to Rellana, Twin Moon Knight, Rellana's younger sister, and former Carian Princess\n* **Observation:** Described as \"steadfast\", Moonrithyll was the \"Twin Moon Knight's chamberlain\"\n* **Quote:** \"She was also a friend to the trolls, who served the royal family, and proudly wielded their weapons as she fought arm in arm with her gargantuan comrades\"\n* **Observation:** Rellana's Cameo, found at the altar directly behind where Moonrithyll is fought, speaks of an \"unparalleled devotion of those who left their homelands to serve Rellana.\"\n* **Quote:** The following quote, included in the description of the Cameo, may be attributed to her, given its proximity to where she was found: *'By your leave, we will accompany you wherever your lunar vessel takes you.'*\n* **Theory:** Physically, she appears to be a genderbent version of Moongrum; their common name structure and respective protection of siblings of Carian royalty (former or otherwise) reinforces the notion that, even if they aren't twins, they may at the very least be siblings or related in some way\n\n**Carian Knight #4: Carian Manor Spirit**\n\n* **Observation:** As the name suggests, this Carian Knight is found at Caria Manor, though they are already deceased\n* **Observation:** When spoken to, their dialogue indicates that their loyalty is specifically to Ranni: \"Lady Ranni, we have long awaited you. I pray for your house's swift arrival. May the full moon shine upon Caria.\"\n* **Observation:** While I cannot directly confirm this myself, this [face guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3275057381) suggests that Moongrum's model is reused here; there's no canon reason to believe this is Moongrum's twin brother, but I won't stop you from speculating\n* **Observation:** It is important to me, for the sake of Carian Knight #17, that this reinforces that Carian Knights were \"direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses\", of which Ranni once was (**EDIT:** This is poorly phrased -- what I'm getting at here is that this Carian Knight seems to not just be a direct retainer to the Carian princesses in general, but possibly specifically to Ranni)\n\n# Carian Troll Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #5: Bols**\n\n* **Observation:** Locked inside the Cuckoo's Evergaol, clearly implying that it was the Knights of the Cuckoo who imprisoned him there, and that he defended Caria when the Academy split from Caria in the aftermath of Radagon's departure\n* **Observation:** Wields the Troll Knight's Sword, specifically with the ability to cast Greatblade Phalanx\n* **Observation:** Drops Greatblade Phalanx when killed, which is said to be used by the enchanted troll knights\n\n**Carian Knight #6: Troll Knight in Caria Manor**\n\n* **Observation:** Effectively the same moveset as Bols (**EDIT:** Just assume this is true for all Troll Knights)\n* **Theory:** By virtue of where this Troll Knight is found, this Troll Knight is still loyal to the Carian Royalty, and is one of the few Troll Knights that are still living\n\n**Carian Knight #7: Troll Knight outside Converted Fringe Tower**\n\n* **Theory:** One can assume, given the role of Carian Knight #6, that this Troll Knight was loyal to the sorcerer controlling the Converted Fringe Tower. It is unlikely this sorcerer was a Carian princess, so it leaves a question as to why the enchanted troll knight here, still clad in Carian armor and wielding Carian weaponry, pledged their loyalty to a sorcerer. However, this would not be the only example of this kind of questionable allegiance, especially because we know that they fell into disarray with the decline of the royal family.\n* **Observation:** This tower in East Liurnia contains Haima sorceries and requires those who enter to be in possession of a Glinstone crown, to know the Erudition gesture, and to perform it in front of the statue of Marika; there is another Converted Tower in West Liurnia with a similar requirement.\n* **Theory:** As this is not a Sorcerer's Rise, and a statue of Marika is found in it, and one must display their \"Erudition\" (or in other terms, their \"Intelligence\") in front of the literal embodiment of \"Faith\", maybe there's something suggesting that these towers were \"converted\" from outposts that once belonged to Erdtree forces to Carian/Academy Towers.\n* **Theory:** Whoever controlled this tower, if it was not Haima themselves (as they were the adjudicator of the Academy), belonged to Haima's conspectus. Given that a Graven School is found here, this particular sorcerer may have some strong ties to the Primeval Current, or at the very least Sellen and Azur. There is definitely some lore worth reconciling.\n\n**Carian Knight #8: Troll Knight in Castle Ensis**\n\n* **Observation:** A similar parallel between Moongrum and Moonrithyll, this Troll Knight parallels the Troll Knight found defending Caria Manor\n* **Theory:** This Troll Knight may explicitly have been friends with Moonrithyll, given her camaraderie with the Troll Knights\n* **Theory:** We can assume a similar characterization with Rellana, i.e. they would have also demonstrated the \"unparalleled devotion of those who left their homelands to serve Rellana.\"\n\n**Carian Knight #9: Blue Spectral Troll Knight in Liurnia Highway North**\n\n* **Observation:** Seemingly protects the road leading to the Academy from Raya Lucarian soldiers. May serve the Twinsage sorcerer at the Highway Lookout Tower, who summons a small squadron of Aristocrats and Wandering Noble Sorcerers in front of the tower.\n* **Theory:** It is worth noting that the Twinsage sorcerer's presence may not be dissimilar to how the Converted Towers were taken over, though in this particular instance, the Twinsage sorcerer took this tower from the Raya Lucarian soldiers...which, seems odd if you consider that they're both supposed to be aligned with the Academy against Caria. The game does allude to the Cuckoo Knights' \"refusal to be mere servants of the academy\", so perhaps these are the embers of a war between Raya Lucaria and the Cuckoos? If so, it is curious to see a Carian Knight on the side of the Academy against the Cuckoos.\n* **Question:** Sort of a general question I have for people who may understand the concept better than I do: I often see these blue spirits referred to as \"puppets\", but can't find an example of where this is explicitly referenced. Do we know for sure that these are puppets?\n* **Theory:** If the above is true, than this Carian Knight, as well as all the Wandering Noble spirits, is clearly under the control of the Twinsage sorcerer, possibly unwillingly\n* **Observation:** In contradiction to the above, there are two cases that I feel contradict the notion of a 'puppet'. The Rennala projection can an oath-sworn Troll, suggesting that the 'oath' may extend beyond life itself, and can be invoked in a manner similar to spirit ashes, though these spirits are not blue. Fia, on the other hand, summons her champions (through what mechanism, I'm not sure), and they definitely *are* blue, which calls into question whether or not they are puppets, or are similarly oath-sworn.\n\n# Headless Spectral Troll Knights\n\n**Carian Knights #10, #11, #12: Headless Spectral Troll Knights guarding the Four Belfries**\n\n* **Observation:** There are three headless knights here, though only one \"spawns\" in the way that Carian Knight #9 does. The other two are seemingly always there.\n* **Observation:** Curiously, even though this area is known as the \"Four Belfries\" there are only three waygates.\n* **Theory:** There is a connection, though unclear, between these Headless Troll Knights and the Mausoleum Soldiers/Knights guarding the Walking Mausoleums and the Black Knife Catacombs. We know that Mausoleum Knights invoked a \"self-inflicted curse that ties the spirits of these loyal knights to the land, having willingly beheaded themselves so that they may serve their masters in death.\"\n* **Theory:** There is no evidence for this, but one potential theory is that each waygate corresponds to one of the Headless Troll Knights. Perhaps it was the sacrifice of each of these knights that closed off the waygates, and it is through an oath or self-inflicted curse that they continue to protect these waygates as spectral beings. It remains unclear what the Four Belfries have to do with Caria, but their being in Liurnia naturally creates strong ties to begin with. Likewise, hard to know whether these waygates are being protected in the name of Caria.\n* **Question:** Maybe people have elaborated on this in other posts, but the relief of a bearded man in front of the branches fo the Erdtree strikes me as similar to the reliefs of the Haligtree found in throughout the Haligtree itself, e.g. on the tombstones found in the graveyard near the Haligtree Roots. Is this a connection or similarity that I'm imagining?\n\n**Carian Knight #13: Headless Spectral Troll Knight guarding Fifth Belfry outside Castle Ensis**\n\n* Pretty much everything stated about Carian Knights #10, #11, and #12 applies to this Carian Knight. Its proximity to Castle Ensis strongly reinforces the connection between the Four Belfries and Caria.\n\n# Unconfirmed, but likely Carian Knights\n\n**Carian Knight #14: The Great Coffin west of Liurnia of the Lakes**\n\n* **Observation:** This Great Coffin stops at the edge of the lake, directly across from Testu's Rise, and contains a Carian Knight's Sword. It is escorted by a large group of Cuckoo soldiers. The path taken by the Great Coffin is also patrolled by a Cuckoo Knight pacing back and forth repeatedly.\n* **Observation:** Though it is now cut content, we know from a note on Great Coffins that they \"travel the Lands Between, carrying the bodies of nameless fallen warriors.\" It is therefore more than reasonable to assume that this Great Coffin is carrying the body of a fallen Carian Knight, though one seemingly respected by the Cuckoos.\n* **Theory:** Stopping at the edge of the western lakeshore may indicate that this Carian Knight has some sort of connection, either a fondness or a desire to be laid to rest here, or maybe it has more to do with the preferences of the Cuckoos escorting the Great Coffin. It's not terribly clear. However, the fact that it is across from Testu's Rise is interesting, as it again paints a picture of a Carian Knight who, possibly, was loyal to a sorcerer. Moreover, Testu may or may not have had abilities related to necromancy, as the puzzle that needs to be solved in order to enter the Rise raises putrid corpses from the ground.\n\n**Carian Knight #15: The Tombstone in Raya Lucaria graveyard**\n\n* **Observation:** Three Putrid Corpses (either possessed by way of sorcery or by glintstone itself) are seemingly worshipping this tombstone, upon which lays the armor of a Carian Knight.\n* **Theory:** One can infer that the tombstone, and therefore the grave it sits atop, once belonged to a Carian Knight, one who possibly lived and died at a time when Caria and the Academy were still aligned. It is unclear why the Putrid Corpses are drawn to this grave, but one can infer that, even in a state of seeming undeath, they retain enough sense to revere this Carian Knight that they may have known, recognized, or even revered in life.\n\n# Unconfirmed, may or may not have been Carian Knights\n\n# \n\n**Carian Knight #16: Corpse in Highway Lookout Tower**\n\n* **Observation:** This corpse is found directly behind the Twinsage sorcerer at the top of the Highway Lookout Tower, though it may be unlikely that the Twinsage sorcerer killed this individual, as the corpse is smoldering. It is in fact identical to the corpse found in the lower levels of the Roundtable Hold, except that it is holding a rusted rapier, possibly suggesting that it was present at the battle that had occurred at Liurnia Highway North involving the Marionettes and the Flame Chariots.\n* **Observation:** Quite critically, the Carian Glintblade Staff is found on this corpse, which we know were gifted to Enchanted Knights. It is unlikely that this staff would be found in the hands of anyone other than a Carian Knight for this express reason.\n* **Observation:** There is precedent for items relating to a specific character being found on a smoldering corpse implied to have been said character: Lionel's armor can be found on a corpse sitting on a bed directly next to where the Deathbed Dress is found. Lionel is already one of Fia's champions, and declared himself to be her father in life when they met, so it's fairly clear that this smoldering corpse was Lionel.\n* **Theory:** Regarding that battle, I think it may have been separate to the battle that is presently occurring between the Cuckoos and the Twinsage sorcerer's blue spectres. Everything being rusted is one indication, but the other is all the Exile Soldier and Banished Knight weaponry found marking the battlefield; this weaponry is also found inside the tower. Stormveil is within riding distance of this area, so it's possible that this was a battle between Stormveil forces and the Academy.\n* **Theory:** Alternatively, given that the Spirit NPC states that the puppets were besieging \"us\", from the perspective of a Wandering Noble Sorcerer spirit, maybe this was where the Academy first betrayed Caria.\n\n**Carian Knight #17: The Ash of War dropped by the Night's Cavalry in Liurnia**\n\n* **Theory:** By far the weakest and maybe the most unnecessary case for a Carian Knight, but I didn't want to ignore it. I had previously made a post suggesting that the Ashes of War dropped by the Night's Cavalry were once the Weapon Skills of warriors that they had defeated. This Ice Spear is said to be a \"skill of the warriors who served Lunar Princess Ranni.\" It does not explicitly state that this is a Carian Knight, but we do know Carian Knight #4 had clear ties to Ranni. Enchanted Knights, when they were a starting class, once wielded the \"Winged Spear\", which eventually became just the \"Spear\" in the final game. In both the CNT and the final game, this weapon \"can be wielded from behind the safety of a raised shield\", which may reference the Carian Knight's Shield, and is also said to be \"very effective against mounted foes\", which suggests that Carian Knights would have encountered mounted foes in Liurnia. While it's likely this could have been referencing Erdtree Sentinels and later Cuckoo Knights, this Enchanted Knight may have come across and been felled by a Night's Cavalry. Moreover, we know that the Spear is infusable; if we look to Blaidd as a reference to what happens when an oath is sworn, his \"sword was imbued with a cold magic at the moment oath was sworn\", which could have occurred if this Enchanted Knight swore an oath to Ranni, granting them the Ice Spear as a Weapon Skill.",

This is, imo, that sort of ancient knowledge. The internal configuration of the rings is different from the current one, but the overall structure is still largely conserved. If this represented Miquella, we would expect to see either his Circlet of Light, or his sigil, as these things represent his godhood and age. But they're absent.\n\nThe central spiral does evoke the Haligtree and it's symbol, but given we know the Spiraltree at least conceptually pre-dates Miquella, and Miquella's own attempt utilizes a pre-existing structure as a base, the more likely explanation for the aforementioned resemblence is that Miquella is attempting to emulate the past. If his goal is to erase a \"sin\" enacted to create the Golden Order, than it makes sense to try and create his Order in the image of the world/Elden Ring **before** that sin was committed.\n\nWhile there is a pretty strong visual resemblence between the appearence of phase 2 PCR in front of the Divine Gate and the Farum Azula Ring, I'm not sure it so directly predicts Miquella. Even if it is a prophecy, is it a prophecy of specifically Miquella's ascension? Or is it like the prophecy of the one who walks alongside flame leading to Destined Death prophecy, where there are technically multiple ways to fulfill its conditions?",

I never noticed this, but they have a bottom jaw bone with teeth wrapped around their head.

Here are a few off the top of my head (spoilers obviously):\n\n* Scholar is a \"young\", 1st generation Albinauric Male.\n* During the Scholars quest, a Godskin Apostle shows up with two Cuckoo Knights to stop you from retrieving the \"Cleansing Tear\". These enemies paired together is interesting, though not surprising to me given what I believe about that whole chunk of the lore.\n* I'm still piecing things together, but I think the Cleansing Tear might end up being the \"birthing droplet\" that Letenna gives to the large Albinauric women at the end of her quest. The Scholar says something along the lines of \"find out manifest desire and reclaim our fair\". I think he believes that it can cure their advanced aging at first, but his quest end by saying \"it has not the power to change our fate. It is however, an artifact of great import - let it be know to history\".\n* The Dreglord has the skull of Manus, has a very similar build and weapons to Manus, and fights like Gael. To me, he is what's left over from the Dark Souls universe, a culmination of corpses after the world converged in on itself at the end of Dark Souls 3, which is why he shares the form and weapon of Manus and fights like Gael, not to mention the reuse of the word \"Dreg\" (The Dreg Heap). Never forget the tweet from the Dark Souls Twitter account prior to the games release: *\"In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright.\"*\n* Edit: Just remembered as well, and I could be completely wrong about this because I'm still putting it all together, but the Undertaker \"might\" be the grown up child of the Recluse.\n\nThat's all I can remember right now, but there is heaps of little things.",

Nothing concrete, really just Headcanon. \n\nFair Warning, this will be long. Why? Because there are potential tangential connections between some things spoken here with other elements of the game\u2019s world. Does any of this matter? No, but it\u2019s fun, if very runny (it\u2019s actually quite messy but I\u2019ll release it as it is; Forsaken Hollows won\u2019t load for me and I\u2019m getting impatient). \n\nThere will also be comments {below} relating to older games. They can be skipped. They are there to connect ideas between games and display common themes. \n\n//////////////////////////////////////\n\nSnake-Snails (Snailkes)\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nWhy do they exist? I think what\u2019s squarely to blame is the Crucible. The Crucible is responsible for animal-like traits being transferred onto humans via mutation, but it\u2019s also tied to creatures such as the Hippopotami, chimeric beasts found in the Realm of Shadow (and who fight alongside Crucible Knights in Nightreign), meaning it also meshes and melds the features of various animals onto other animals. \n\nThere are five Snake-Snail variants (one unused). The standard Snake-Snails appear in Volcano Manor, appropriately, as well as in other disparate location such as Nokstella and Rauh. They drop Serpent Arrows, attributed to a group known as the Formless Serpents. They slither, bite, and spit poison. Not much to note, but the Rauh location feels like it points towards my Crucible Hypothesis rather cleanly. \n\nThe Volcano Manor hosts the God-Devouring Serpent so there\u2019s a correlation with their appearance there. \n\nIt should be noted that you can connect Snakes with the element of fire in this game via their symbology, finding their way amongst the Godskins, Rykard, and Messmer; one of Messmer\u2019s symbols is a caduceus (a classical symbol involving two snakes), a sort of spiral, thus perhaps associating the snake with the Crucible and its spiral symbol; a connection possible to make due to minor details like how flame spirals in various magical forms, such as Furnace Golems which have Fire Giant Masks, giants being blessed by the Crucible according to the Talisman-of-all-Crucibles, and Embers of Messmer\u2019s being used to craft Fire Spritestones out of Rauh Burrows. The physiology of Godskin Nobles are also compared to the melding of the Crucible via their robes, and they bear reptilian tails. \n\nSnakes are also associated with poison, obviously; it should also be noted that Marais Manor, east and downstream of Gelmir, apparently once hosted the wielders of the Serpent Arrows (according to early versions - 1.00 apparently; my only source is a spreadsheet put together by Garden of Eyes); the House and its members are sick and associated with poison. \n\nNokstella is a harder locale to connect, especially since I know most people haven\u2019t even noticed the Snake-Snails there. They are found in a small section of the lower city, to the right of the river going downstream from the Nokstella Grace. There are no real connections here, besides tangential connections of a distant nature which don\u2019t explain much of anything. \n\n1. Ranni was involved with the Eternal Cities, getting its assassins to her side. Her brother is connected to her conspiracy to assassinate Godwyn, but that doesn\u2019t really explain the Snake-Snails\u2019 appearance here. \n2. (Warning: Unhinged Archaeology [\ud83e\udd2e] Speculation) The Eternal Cities have no connection to the Crucible, but the Night may. Dewgems are lotus flowers found in the Realm of Shadow which are fed on Night-tinged dew. They are found by water here, notably appearing in Rauh. Another night related thing in this realm are Larval Tears which are conjured at Spirit Graves at Night. They are functionally the same as the Silver Larvae in the base game. There isn\u2019t much here; they aren\u2019t really anything besides natural vermin (I was going to go off on a tangent about the giant stone coffins which are depicted on stelae in the Ancient Dynastical territories; some SOTE concept art depicts one atop Rauh; basically I was going to say that the Rauh people became the Ancient Dynasties and Nox, but that\u2019s too conspiratorial for talking about why snake-snails are in Nokstella; especially since it doesn\u2019t even explain anything besides why they\u2019re in both locations). \n3. The Silver Tears of the Nox are based on Alchemical beliefs regarding quicksilver, a fluctuating semi-fluid substance. An important symbol of Alchemy is the snake (in other esoteric systems it can take the form of the Ouroburos), sometimes depicted as a three headed dragon representing salt (body), quicksilver (mind), and sulfur (soul). The caduceus is a related symbol consisting of snakes forming a spiral. A word that can be used to conceptually tie these things together is the word \u201cformless\u201d; it\u2019s used to describe multiple things relating to the Arcane stat, such as the Formless Mother, the \u201cFormless\u201d Dragon Communion Seal (according to the seal\u2019s description), and the Formless Serpents and \u201cFormless\u201d Silver Tears (according to the Silver Tear Mask description). \n\nThe Cobra-Snails got cut from the game so there\u2019s nothing to talk about regarding them. \n\nInstead we could talk about the arrows and their accompanying bow. I mentioned earlier that an early version of the game stated that the Formless Serpents were once minions of Marais; the bow is found in the Abandoned Cave, full of trashed Abductor Virgins. It would stand to reason these Formless Serpents were possibly minions of Rykard, the cave dump being a Volcano Manor storage site in Caelid due to an alliance between the Carian brothers\u2019. Radahn may\u2019ve had use for them, who knows. The bow is powered by pagan magic; Arcane; the God-Devouring Serpent potentially being considered a pagan God (alluded to by the Serpent-God\u2019s Curved Sword). The arrows have a caduceus in place of fletching. \n\nMakes me wonder\u2026 perhaps the Formless Serpents used Invisibility Sorcery to get their moniker, potentially because the dump is near Sellia and some Serpent-Snails are found in Nokstella?\n\nI bring that up because the Serpent-Snails drop the arrows for some reason. That always felt weird to me. They don\u2019t have pockets. Do we make them from them? Is this the only way (other than corpses) the devs could think of to get us these arrows? It feels like a Dark Souls 2 situation to me where we needed a certain animal enemy to drop a certain human item (I\u2019m specifically referencing the kobolds that drop Black Knight weapons). \n\nOther than them there is the crystal Snake-Snail, one you might encounter earlier as they appear in the Lakeside Crystal Cave. They appear in multiple locations where crystals are present, such as the Altus Tunnel, the broader Liurnian area, the Consecrated Snowfield (ice is crystal and treated as a type of Glintstone, appearing as buds here like the Crystal Bud), Sellia Crystal Tunnel, and the Moonlight Altar. \n\nGlintstone parasitizes life, as demonstrated by the Glintstone Fireflies they can drop. They can still spit poison and have additional powers such as spitting Glintstone as projectiles or trails. The areas they inhabit have the same overarching crystalline visuals so their crystalline properties are explainable, but why snake-snails in these locations? Besides crystal, (some of) these locations have Carian associations (which could involve Rykard) such as the Altus and Sellia Tunnels which have Crystallians at their ends. The Moonlight Altar is Carian property and those in base Liurnia are around the crystalline zones below the altar. The Snowfield holds the Rotten Duelists who are decorated with snakes; the snakes come \u201calive\u201d during grab attacks\u2026 but the Duelists have no apparent lore other than serving in ritual combat during Godfrey\u2019s reign, the snake being a despised symbol. Why are they rotten? Did they fight alongside Radahn/Malenia? Is it rotten blood? Did they enter Malenia\u2019s rotten gash? Besides them, Ordina is nearby, has Black Knife Assassins in its gaol, and Loretta serves the Haligtree, so\u2026 \n\nHonestly, there\u2019s no straightforward reason these little guys are so widespread, and aren\u2019t so widespread. Symbolic associations are nearby, but not every Crystallian cave is accompanied by Snake-Snails. Their presence is arbitrary. \n\nSkeletal Snake-Snails are\u2026 still snaily. They still fold into their shells and their skeleton\u2019s length is the same as the others. Their\u201dshells\u201d are large humanoid skulls. They are found in the Death Bird section of the graveyard within Leyndell\u2019s outer layer of walls, the Sage\u2019s Grotto (With Garris; Black Knife Assassin nearby), and the mass graveyard atop the Mountaintops (with the Mariner). \n\nThey are among Those Who Live in Death. They can breathe out Ghostflame Wraiths and nothing else. They can roll like the others, touching mouth to tail, which is interesting. It may not be intentional but this would replicate the shape of an Ouroboros. The Ouroburos is a symbol of a snake eating its own tail, symbolizing the cycle of life and death; rebirth. Since they live within death I would say this is fitting. \n\nThe graveyards they appear in are supposedly for the Golden Order as one is found in Leyndell\u2019s walls and the other is in the Mountaintops where the Golden Order fought the Giants. The latter does contain giant spirits, possibly traitors of the Fire Giants, like the trolls; if not it may be a grave for those before (astrologers and giants). Both have a local Deathbird so it\u2019s possible that both yards predate Order. Snakes would fit then, but why didn\u2019t the Order excise these elements? \n\nGarris\u2019s cave is an undead sanctuary, the snakes acting as Garris\u2019s familiars (the sheltering of the assassin here also makes sense). The cave is downstream of Mount Gelmir. \n\nSnakes are related to spirituality as seen by Rykard and Eingley, their body containing many spirits, even summoning them via the mouth and the dispersed heat from unsettling the corpses that make up the cavern floor (if you hadn\u2019t noticed, the mist that summons the fire wraiths during his fight is amassed from his swings hitting the ground). \n\nThe last Snake-Snail is the Spiritcaller Snail. They lack snail eyes and they shake their heads and tails to emit a ringing like a Spiritcaller Bell to summon forth spirits. One is in the Road\u2019s End Catacombs summoning a Crucible Knight to its defense. One lingers in the top floor of the Leyndell Catacombs where it summons Leyndell soldiers to its defense. A few are posted up in the Haligtree Village to summon Crystallians. A bunch of them linger in the Spiritcaller\u2019s Cave, summoning wolves, disciples of Okina, and Godskins. \n\nIt would seem to me that these guys are actually deployed, not just nesting. They may have an affinity with spirits but they defend positions strategically such as, what would\u2019ve been, the entrance to the Leyndell Catacombs, the Road\u2019s End\u2019s roots, and the Haligtree Village Roofs. It could just be coincidence. The Cave seems like their natural habitat as it flows with a magic river which supports the nearby flora (magic is residual life energy as explained by Sellen\u2019s explanation of Glintstone, as well as the forces behind Ghostflame and the powers of Ancestral Spirits and their followers). \n\nThe Cave is very interesting. We see wolves settle other caves so it seems they all perished but are kept alive by the snails who use them for defense. The disciples, the Inaba, chased Okina after he abandoned them. They sought death through combat, having found it and becoming fodder for the snails. The Godskins are the most thought-provoking inclusion. Their ghosts here would seem to imply some Godskin presence in the Mountaintops some time ago. There is a heavy fiery presence on the Mountaintops; besides the Fire Giants; it\u2019s possible Messmer served here due to the impalement of the giants and the presence of the Giant/Fell mask(s) on the Furnace Golems. Melina lights the Forge and is possibly the Gloam-Eyed Queen. I\u2019m not sure if the cult had a start on the Mountaintops but it might make sense given the fight with the Godskins and the war with the Giants happened early in Marika\u2019s reign. \n\nDon\u2019t remember if I mentioned it, but the Godskins are associated with snakes via one on Gelmir. I suppose the Snakes of this cave can further this connotation; this snaky connotation is further bolstered by the fact both the Godskins and Rykard wish to usurp. \n\nAn early fringe theory I remember is that the Godskins are Eternal City adjacent. Why? A few things. They morph like how quicksilver is described, though there is no shared visual language; there\u2019s also no shared visual language with the Crucible either. If they are kin to Melina it could at least explain some connection since they would be kin to Marika. The main connection is their use of black flame like how the Assassins use the Rune of Death, but the assassins are later, after the failed rebellion; they have a common cause at least. The Godskins are supporting rebelling forces, siding with Rykard (one also defends the death-stricken corpse of Ranni, the main plotter who used the assassins). \n\nSnake-Snails (Snailkes) inherit the broader symbolism of snakes, that being spirituality. The crystal ones contain Glintstone, the skeletal ones breathe wraiths, and the Spiritcallers summon spirits; Eingley contains and amasses spirits, etc\u2026\n\nI forgot to mention earlier, but the Abyssal Serpent of Messmer is also spiritual to some extent. The Furnace Pot says the flames of the Furnace Golems burn away both body and soul. The furnaces feasibly contain a combo of Fell and Abyssal Flame, but given the connotation of the Abyss and Serpents (harkening back to Dark Souls) it would seem the Abyssal Flame is what does the consumption. Flame is very spiritual; the Frenzied Flame similarly destroys souls, the Fell Flame is conducted by the Fell God who lives on through his subjects, Ghostflame destroys bodies and raises spirits, Destined Death\u2019s flames ensure death for body and soul, and the Black Flame is more ambiguous, being the tool of death for the Godskins, but potentially a weaker/ened version of Destined Death. \n\nThis theme of serpentine spirituality goes back to earlier games.\n\n////////\n\nSlugs\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nThe basic slug appears to be wrapped in a blanket of filth, appearing in filthy places themselves. They amass in the pools of the Shaded Castle, the moat around the Capital, the misty woods of the Altus (where they spit Deathblight), the sewers where they squelch in slop and manure, and even in Castle Sol. They typically spit slime to slow you (like a velvet worm) and drop white flesh. They are associated with filth, and perhaps death due to Sol and the woods. \n\nThere are also fire slugs. They appear on Mount Gelmir, but aren\u2019t exclusive to there. They appear near smoldering butterflies which flutter around in some very random areas; they also drop them. A batch can be found near the road to the Limgrave colosseum; to the right of the road leading there, just before the overhead bridge. Another batch is found on the lower plateau southeast of the Church of Vows; Fire Monks camp out here. Another bunch are on the right of the large walkway leading from the Outer Wall Phantom Tree Grace; before the Leyndell main gate walkway. Another bunch are northeast of the Guardian\u2019s Garrison. A bunch more are also found on the right side of the frozen river leading to Theodorix. Who knows if these are a species of their own or just slugs that have adapted to fire? I tried to figure this out via their neighboring butterflies. Smoldering Butterflies are found near fires, but are they the cause of them or merely follow them? I\u2019d say in some cases they follow such as seen with campfires; you\u2019d have to kill them in order to use them to start fires, so I don\u2019t think they intentionally start fires themselves. It\u2019s entirely pointless but are Burning Slugs another species, do fires transform slugs into them; are the butterflies responsible for wildfires; and why are these slugs sometimes found in such random locations? My hypothesizes are: Burning Slugs are a species and cause fires, attracting butterflies; butterflies cause fires and slugs burn in them; both are just attracted to fires (but were they burning before or no?).\n\n///////////\n\nSlimes\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nSlimes are messes of filth and dead flesh. They\u2019re made from necrotic flesh and can contain maggots, feathers, hair, and bones. They have many variants, including poison, rot, blood, lightning, and putrescence. They seem to be creatures that have melted and amassed, yet still live due to the Rune of Death being taken away, such undying devastation being possible because of the Shattering war which has caused \u201cdead\u201d masses to congeal and transform. \n\nWithout access to the roots, and with traditional death being gone, these things amass in squalid conditions where the dead go unburied (Rot brings forward new life). They\u2019re their own living things now. \n\nThe basic kind are found in the squalid muck outside the Murkwater Catacombs, on the ramparts of the Lower Morne Castle, in corners of Redmane Castle, Wyndham Catacombs, and the Consecrated Snowfield. \n\nThe poisonous green kind are found in the pools of the Tombsward Cave and Seethewater Cave. \n\nThe rotten kind can be found in certain areas in Caelid, but prominently in the Minor Erdtree Catacombs. They seem to contain bug shells like those of the Kindred of Rot. \n\nThe bloody kind seem fresh as they are soaked red and covered in blisters. They are found in the Writhblood Ruins, Moghwyn Palace, and Blood Ruins in Nightreign. They may be made of the Dynasty\u2019s victims, perhaps they are ritually soaked to be kept bloody for the mother. \n\nThe lightning kind are found on the Jagged Peak, surging with red lightning. They\u2019re probably made of melted dragon, particularly the Drakes who inherited Bayle\u2019s Lightning. Either that or they\u2019re made of the men who made the climb. Perhaps a mix of both. \n\nThe Putrescence is the remains of ancient beings once contained in the colossal coffins of the Cerulean Coast and Fissure. The flesh is sloppy, wet, and mucky; it doesn\u2019t appear like rotten flesh, instead more like frozen cafeteria slop. I suppose these would form in cold conditions like the fissure; they\u2019ve had time to melt and accumulate. They were burnt by cold Ghostflame in the past (according to the Putrescence Spells), perhaps helping make their melted appearance and color; the conditions are also similar to the Gaols which are lit with Ghostflame and have their own brand of wet amassed flesh (It\u2019s possible the Hornsent were inspired by the practice of the coffins). This flesh is close to the spiritual as well as it can be used to make Piquebone Arrows which conjure shadows where they land, shadows which appear similar to those produced by the Alluring Pot which bears the markings of the Two Fingers, and are made with bone shards and Albinauric Blood; this suggests a spiritual power is behind the \u201cillusion\u201d, and implications regarding Albinaurics; are Albinaurics spiritual due to the \u201csilver\u201d they\u2019re made of? I remember some people suggesting that the putrescence is made of constructed people, like claymen/silver-beings as to explain the illusion and these peoples\u2019 supposed impurity according to the congealed putrescence description (the shadows are similar in appearance to Shadow Bait, a spell of the Two Fingers which suggests they may have some spiritual power, or are at least skilled conjurors; Rhia isn\u2019t far away, and they can create Shadows as servants; according to Recluse\u2019s questline one cannot live without a shadow). Putrescence at least has bones as can be seen by skeletons that animate among it, as well as the Putrescent Knight; to note, its cleaver scales off Arcane; is this due to the nature of putrescence or is it the nature of the corpses? Also to note: Silver Tear weapons do not scale with arcane, but the Silver Tear Mask improves it so\u2026 ehh?\n\n(Archaeology Speculation) The coffins are a curiosity, but are possibly predecessors to the Ancient Dynasty as they depict the same bearded man their statues depict, a bull (which is one of the dynasty\u2019s icons), and they\u2019re depicted at the top of the Dynasty Stelae. The worship of horns is also shared by the Ancestral Followers around the Dynasty ruins and Hornsent who live in the land of the coffins. The stelae also depicts trees as important, so I\u2019d presume some shaman/Hornsent connection here as both worshipped trees (Enir Ilim has trees with faces; the God who entered the gate, Marika, was presumably gifted the Erdtree\u2019s seed by the Two Fingers according to the Seed +1 Talismans; the Hornsent would presumably worship the Two Fingers, seen by the shack outside Rhia and praying corpse in Dheo, as they desired a God); also the Nox settled their cities near these ruins (they are Marika\u2019s relatives). I also have to mention the DLC concept art, that of a coffin atop Rauh\u2026 what does this mean? Were they built atop stuff and then slid down when\u2026 whatever catastrophe that happened\u2026 happened? Be it a fallen star, be it volcanos, the coffins sunk into the stone. \n\nDid the coffins once summon a God? Is that what the Hornsent is basing their massacre upon? The jarred shamans are made of accumulated flesh and can have many faces; they also fire homing flesh, and their title as shamans connotates some spiritual strength, so were they chosen above others to be massacred for being potent spiritual fuel? \n\nI was going to actually talk about Silver Tears and the Molten Tears, but those are an entirely different topic, even if Silver Tears relate to alchemy like snakes, and morph like slime.

    "body": "This is the third of a series of posts where I delve into the the narrative of Elden ring as an introspective journey Marika undergoes externally through the journeys of the mending rune bearing tarnished after her disillusionment with the order and her grief in relation to the death of Godwyn's soul.\n\nFia as a mother to Godwyn, opressed life giver and ritualistic prostitute.\n\nGoldmask as a sage and soul seeker in the depth of the golden order.\n\nDung eater as the manifestation of the hornsent's foul legacy and the karmic dept or sin that was born of what they did to her and what she did to them.\n\nThis is going to be THE longest post of the three as even though Dung eater as a character appears to be the least interesting of the bunch and his questline is best described as deranged and his mending rune as morally abhorrent. His existence or rather what he represents is a surrender to generational hatred and an embrace of original sin itself.\n\nThe sun realm :\n\nThe sun realm is precisely mentioned in ONE item description on a random chance drop shield but it's existence is hinted at constantly and consistently through most of the lands between.\n\nBefore the DLC all we had were a bunch of inconsistent and quite frankly worthless information about a bunch of skeletons and wraiths. But with the robust portrayal of the hornsent we can confidently confirm that : the sun realm did exist, it did dominate the lands between, it practiced storm and divine beast veneration as aspects of the crucible and partook in dragon communion, stuborn clinging to life, it's main fighting force were the banished knights led by commanders Niall and O'Niel (meaning son of Niel or Niall btw) and most importantly it honored death. The sun realm is not necessarily the hornsent but they are it's ideological and cultural center, not all of them need to bear horns.\n\nThe most ancient elden lord we find in the story of the lands between is Placidussax who lies in the storm beyond time at the heart of Farum Azula and the beasts that serve him. Now their wildness and vitality drained away in exchange for the fingers and intelligence granted upon them (descriptions of the cinquedea and beastial vitality). The hornsent worship this storm and venerate it and the beasts who dwell in it and their movements as the most ancient signifier of divinity and primacy. The banished knights, who use these storm innovations, partake in dragon communion to honor the ancient dragons, have dragons on their helmets and were given the choice of either banishment or servitude to Godfrey after his defeat of the lord of stormveil. The ones that accepted still render service to the golden lineage to this day in stormveil serving Godrick, the ones that refused either prowl Farum Azula, or the mountaintops and Caelid as ghosts let by their commanders. In nightreign, the banished knights in the castle even kneel to the horned colosseum lion in front of the gate. The banished knight armor and weaponry even litters practically every major non Carian fort in the lands between. Architectural clues are also very useful here, as Castle Sol is named after the sun, the eclipe imagery is also very clear adding to the sun connotations. Castle morne is also under control of the golden lineage as Castellan Edgar is there under orders of Godrick. \n\nThe sword of castle morne is also a massive hint linking the banished knights, stormveil, the sun realm and the death birds. As the model for the sword without the other blades grafted on top is similar to the death ritual spear and feather branch talisman, not just in design but also in spirit. The spear is the weapon of those accepted by the death birds to strengthen them but also a symbol of the promise of the death birds to repay that companionship with resurrection in the far future. The sword strengthens the user through channeling the spirits of the fallen clan still laying in the grafted blade in promise of vengeance. Stormveil castle also has some fascinating architectural clues as the two towers that look like they have a bite taken out of them near where you find the claw talisman bear a striking resemblance to the divine gate of Enir Illim. The claw talisman also depicts assassins who mimic the deathbirds.\n\nBut the most fascinating clues, are found not found there, they're in the shadow keep. As the shadow keep while not containing any banished knight equipment, holds a mass grave of knights where you fight commander Gaius. The architecture of the shadow keep is also not consistent, meaning some parts were probably built later as older parts more used as civillian ground became abandoned. The most damning part about the shadow keep being older than the war was the boats used to burn the soldier's golden ashes that are one to one the same boats the tibia mariners sail and use to guide the spirits lost in death. The helphen steeple also bears a striking resemblance to the steeples seen in the flooded part of the shadow keep, which should be an older part of the keep, called the church district.\n\nAncient Mesopotamia, again :\n\nEnir Illim, based on Bab-Ellim or Babylon is very clearly meant to reference the tower of Babylon meant to stretch to the heavens and reach God.\n\nIn Mesopotamia, one of the main partners of trade and relations was Dilmun. Dilmun was so important it was part of the Mesopotamian creation mythos as a paradise where there is no disease, predators eat no predators, pain is absent and people do not get old. As such it has several recently unearthed mass burial sites. This mythical land was ruled by the benevolent god Inzak, Anzak, Enzak or as he was known in the initial publications and research... Enshag. Making an interesting tie to the supposed lord of the lost and the desperate whose golden bones still cling to life even after all these years worn as armor by Gideon's lackey who's obsessed with getting the medallion leading to castle sol, Ensha. Clinging to life being necessary to provide a death worth offering to the death birds is a theme that ties Ensha to the death birds, tying all this giant mess into a semi coherent society with a center of culture and different regional practices befitting an empire spanning the whole of the lands between. The gate of divinity being the culmination of generations of spirituality and development into the harvesting of death as a way to create life. Life rises from death as it does from life, and from life through death, one gains power as stated by the remembrance of the regal ancestor. The great hammer given from this remembrance's horns are described as wings to reap the lives of the hornless. The horns of an ancestor spirit continue to bud like antlers as life that experiences no sprouting is offered to it through death creating tangled horns, to the hornsent their proof to be a chosen people. And winged creatures are said to be the envoys of death in ancient pagan faith as said by the winged scythe. The gate of divinity can be therefore assumed to be an attempt at creating the ultimate regal ancestor spirit, a true divine beast, that will reap the life of the hornless, melded harmoniously through shaman women flesh and deliver the hornsent to greater heights. A tradition carried on by Godrick through grafting the dead onto his shaman flesh that harmoniously blends with all others. The spiralhorn shield is therefore one of the earliest depictions and an abservation of the spiral current of the crucible by the primal people of Siofra, the ansestor followers funny enough are still found barely clinging in the lake of rot which poisons the ainsel river and both are massive and ancient burial grounds where corpses are thrown in stone coffins. The old man with the tablet, elden John as some call him in the communtiy, is a representative of the hornsent's ancient people's ancient people studied through the ruins of Rauh. And in his hands he holds a one to one replica of an artifact from Mesopotamia, the imago mundi, or map of the world. Mesopotamia itself means the land between two rivers, in the real world the tigris and euphrates, in elden ring, the ainsel and the siofra. The formless mother, in her infinite kindness to lord Mohg in the sewers, showed him his cursed blood's glorious past leading to his righteous desire to revive it, making him retreat to the ruins underground to learn of his lineage. Elden John has been discussed to death in the communtiy and has been found all over the place, Uld ruins, Rauh ruins, the ancient giant coffins and Enir Ellim. Giving the sun realm much deeper roots than belurat and the tower.\n\nHorah Loux - Serosh / Enkidu - Gilgamesh\n\nBut Mesopotamian mythos and it's connection to Elden ring doesn't end here. Gilgamesh was a prideful despot that the god Enki tried to teach a lesson to in humility to the gods. Enki creates a son then named Enkidu, son of Enki. Enkidu lives as one among beasts like horah loux until he is seduced and screwed into submission by a priestess of ishtar named Shamhat for 7 days and nights straight leading to the depletion of his exess in wildness and his civilization by her hand. Enkidu is then apalled when hearing about Gilgamesh and his actions and goes on to fight him to the death. From that fight is born a deep respect between both of them and Gilgamesh's pride is doubled. He then decides to cement his greatness by slaying the divine beast Humbaba that lives in a forest of giant trees after forging axes to do the deed. Humbaba is killed after Enkidu offers guidance and courage to Gilgamesh but now Enkidu's life is forfait as the gods punish him for the death of Humbaba. Gilgamesh learns beyond grief, and absolutely paralyzing fear of death and goes to the underworld to find a way to gain immortality. He gets in the form of a magical fish, he leaves the underworld and as he celebrates in a bath, his fish is eaten, by a serpent, the serpent then becomes immortal and keeps shedding it's skin every time Gilgamesh tries to kill it or in elden ring terms a serpent never dies. After more depression and monologue, dialogue... Gilgamesh decides to learn humility and instead be immortalised in his deeds through the smiles of his people and the stories they tell about him.\n\nThe hatred of the erdtree towards the serpent from the days of Godfrey here can be understood not only from the biblical sens but also Mesopotamian sens of usurpation of immortality from the king. Besides it's connotations and relations to the fell god, but that needs a whole discertation on its own.\n\nThe whole moral of the story is the acceptance of death by a man and a people that tenaciously and pridefully cling to life.\n\nThe culture of the hornsent while having tones of respect for the elders, the dead and valuing life had their culture slowly turn into a cesspool of hatred, fear of death and denial of their atrocities as specified by the caterpillar mask but also denial of the truth as they imprisoned the lamenter.\n\nTheir curse to turn into flies is fitting divine punishment and proof that the hornsent deeply lacked empathy as the people who cared for the sick never became ill. The mother of flies is excellent at offering punishment and she seems quite fond of showing herself to the horned like the bloodfiends who saw a twisted deity in the visage of their tutelary deity.\n\nThere's even a multitude of theories saying the ritual to ascend to godhood requires death of the lord with good proof as Miquella reproduces this without flaw. So then as the golden prince and a lordling, Godwyn's death would have been necessary for him to ascend as lord of Ranni. His mending rune even evokes a black sun, but Marika's plans to put forth Godwyn as her candidate for lordship in the war she planned ever since she banished Godfrey broke. And through his incomplete death, Godwyn became first of the undead and ruler of those who live in death. A continuation of the sun realm tradition, his resurrection was even planned through a failed eclipse. Mohg even respects this tradition yet challenging Godwyn's ancestral claim by declaring his dynasty the Mohgwyn dynasty. Ansbach, a pureblood knight of Mohg is educated enough in these people's customs that he is able to decipher the rite of ascension to Godhood.\n\nThe hornsent are a very prideful, rotten people who's spirits cling to their descendants and whose ancestors persisting as tutelary deities is an honor. Taylew, a golem that was small, weak and the first one to stop functioning was honored through death into becoming the guardian deity of smithing. Meaning there is genuine power and true honor in being first of the dead, a theme in Miyazaki's older works as well.\n\nThe omen curse : \n\nThe curse of the omen manifests in tangled horns all over the body, a very distinct muscular and monstrous frame and nightmares. Golden black fire like the scadutree is seen attacks by omen with royal blood who still have their horns intact. The hornsent don't exhibit these traits.\n\nMarika was so afraid of the curses of the hornsent that she directed Messmer to be the bearer of this curse in her stead. But as his kindling states, that hatred would not be confined. He even curses her himself for his last words.\n\nIn the dlc one of the first ghosts you see speaks to his dead fellows telling them to keep clinging to their hatred so he can fashion curses from it. The grandam has acess to a wraith spell manifesting rancor, the horned bairn item is similar to the omen bairn in function, the hornsent NPC is eaten alive by his desire for vengeance, the revenger of castle morne clings to the souls of his clan through their blades to grant him strength, Ensha refuses to give up on life, the red and blue branch talismans... there's so many examples of hornsent and sun realm clinging to life beyond death and showing rancor as the result. The hornsent are extremely adept at cursing people, at least that's the conclusion I arrived at.\n\nThe omen curse is not the aspects of the crucible randomly being propped into existence. It's the conclusion of an active effort of a dead people to curse the souls of the people of the erdtree. Through their very bloodlines. The curse, when unleashed by Morgott calls forth a spiral of tarnished, dull red gold that causes a rainstorm to occur. Similar to the divine invocation. Mohg through his acceptance of the formless mother and his cursed blood, is able to channel his plight into wings echoing the very first divine warriors who learned from the birds. To note, the deathbirds, not the death rite birds, have shriveled wings that have a brownish color that fades into a dull yellow and then gray. The twin bird is depicted as both red and blue.\n\nThe dung eater : finally.\n\nThe dung eater when viewed through this context is a manifestation of hatred and the weight that causality holds in the world of elden ring. His armor, exised horns with a large pendant depicting the sun, evokes a desire to embody the very concept of hatred of the golden order and the annihilation of the hornsent at their hands. His barbarity isn't random, he says so himself, that he has to defile every corpse with care, it's ritualistic. His screams even call forth the wraiths similar to the omen and hornsent, a blessing and guidance from his ancestors. He doesn't just want to do it. He feel he has to do it to honor his ansestors restless spirits demanding vengeance, it's a duty.\n\nThe dung eater is a tarnished, not an omen. He is a descendant of a warrior of Godfrey making his link to the sun realm by bloodline quite probable.\n\nA seedbed refers to the genital area of males, more specifically the testes and can be used as euphemism for the general area of the crotch. Dung eater's victims all apear to be exclusively male, with a bloody crotch. So when he says he's cursing your bloodline, he's doing it literally, straight from the source.\n\nHis realisation that he needs to be the recepient of his blessing is a repetition or parody of the jarring of the shamans as instead of self reflection upon the evil act he fully accepts it and even goes through it to ensure his vengeance.\n\nA surrender to hate and cycles of violence and curses, dead in a sewer, after a lifetime of misery inflicted upon others and himself. A grand and brilliant fate to such a storied and deeply rooted civilisation. The karmic dept of the world becoming so deeply entrenched, Marika alone can't bear it, everyone has to bear it's consequence as there is no way to sever causality and the first sin will follow all. Marika through this refuses to let go of the past and embraces letting all the world share in the curses flung at her.\n\nFeel free to give feedback.\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Those first two likely had important purposes too. \n\n-the one at the Moonlight Alter protects three gazebos, each with somber smithing materials. This is likely a wedding challenge intended for her betrothed, and the gift was materials to empower their matrimonial Dark Moon Greatsword. It's one of many hints Ranni was in an arranged marriage at one point in her history, likely to Godwyn. \n\n-The one at the Carian Manor Estate prowls the family graveyard, most likely protecting the grave of a child Rennala and Radagon lost. The painting \"Resurrection\" leads us to this graveyard, the painter's paintings reflect the last focus of a departed soul, and the spirit faces the academy before dropping the clothes of the Juvenile Scholars. Between the title and the bounty, the indication reflects Rennala's purpose with the Amber Egg. They call it rebirth and reincarnation, so there was an original birth and an original incarnation, and they were likely Carian offspring. There's actually two distinct juvenile scholar models too, so it may have been twins, which I find appropriate because they have a number of curious foils with Miquella. \n\n-The third is much harder to read into. I think it likely a test for any who come seeking the Fingerslayer, but it's a bit too far away from there to serve that purpose, so either it strayed or it's actually here to protect something else. One might would think it strayed to join the wolf pack, but they're not native to here either, so they likely came here with it in the first place. Perhaps it's more about the Ancestral Follower activities here, they are essentially working with spirits, Ranni is a spirit bound to a doll. At the temple just beyond this wolf we find the Ancestral Infant's Head, which is suggested to sprout trees from spirits. Perhaps the idea is to prevent Ranni from becoming involved with such practices. No trees for Ranni. \n\nSome of the others have potential purposes too, but at that point I'm just posting an essay about the red wolves.",

Each level of the Divine tower gets smaller and smaller, and the base is noticeably thicker than anything in the base game.

Everyone thought it was going to involve Velka... And it was about THE FURTIVE PIGMY, SO EASILY FORGOTTEN! ROFL \n\n\nSotE? Everyone thought it was going to be about GEQ, Death and Godwyn... And it was about Miquella's relationship with Mogh, Radahn's duel with Malenia, the origins of Marika and the curse of divinity. It was about Dragon Communion, and the origins of The Fingers; all interesting things that no one was really paying much attention to. If anything, I think they followed up on an unprecedented amount of stuff. I'm all for it and I truly love what they wrote, but they don't usually explain \"so much\" lol\n\n\nIf they wanted, they could revisit many other loose threads that were left open, and it would never really feel off. The world is rich, if vague. There's enough space to expand in literally any direction and that's fully intentional.",

I feel like people don't realize what that means. \n\nIf Miquella has already decided he's going to be a god and has set a plan in motion, then at that point he already knows about the ritual scroll. He knows that what is needed is a Lord's \\*\\*soul\\*\\* and a vessel for it. Meaning he already knew Radahn would have to die and is asking him to be his Consort \\*within that context\\*. He just asked Radahn to die. \n\n  \nThere's lore on Radahn's take on his own death, he wants to ensure he dies in honorable combat. He wants someone to kill him as he fights with all his might. He made a vow with Jerren saying this. \n\n  \nThis is what Malenia was doing in the Battle of Aeonia. The Young Lion set confirms this, since it tells us that when Malenia fought Radahn and let the scarlet flower bloom, she whispered in his ear: \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort\". She was there to kill him, per the vow. When she wakes up in the Haligtree she mentions that she is \"awaiting his return\", referring to Miquella. She knows he's off becoming a god and expects him to return with Radahn. \n\n  \nMiquella mentions \"our part of the vow\" in that flashback. That's what their part of the vow was. At the start of the Promised Consort fight, Miquella thanks both Malenia and the Tarnished for killing Radahn. Miquella and Radahn talked about the vow and Radahn agreed under the condition that he could meet his (again, necessary) death in honorable combat. \n\nThe Young Lion Armor has a Haligtree symbol on the cape and we see that during this time in his life, Radahn used the swords of Light and Lord. The descriptions of those swords imply that there's \\*something else\\* besides \"physical strength\" and \"gravity\" that Radahn relies on. It's Miquella. He uses the swords again when he becomes the Promised Consort. \n\nTo preemptively address a popular argument: people get hung up on the wording \"honorable\" combat, saying Malenia wasn't \"honorable\", but I think it just means to kill him while he's fighting his hardest in this case. But even if you don't like that, it's implied that Malenia never intended to go that far in the first place, he was simply so powerful that to kill him she had no choice but to use her hail Mary ult that literally cost her a piece of herself, just to meet his measure. And even doing that she didn't manage to kill him. \n\n  \nI think the vow with Jerren was probably made once the Battle at Aeonia was decided, to have Jerren ensure he dies \\*in combat specifically\\*. Because that's how he wants to die. ",

It\u2019s just the way things went. Truthfully, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s who I am at all.\n\nIf I\u2019m being honest, what I really think; I\u2019m nobody. I\u2019m nothing. I don\u2019t have much family, and all of my friends have their own.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019ve ever done of any value in this life is bring people entertainment with my clips and my lore posts. \n\nSo maybe who I am is the Limgrave Butcher, and what I do is entertain the people who love these games just as much as I do.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be. Just a blip. \n\nI often daydream about a reality where I\u2019m somebody more than what I really am. A reality in which I\u2019m not just bringing a smile to dozens of people\u2019s faces; but to everyone on this planet who needs one. But I know I\u2019ll never live up it.\n\nSo thank you, for enjoying my posts. Even the ones where I\u2019m being silly. You may be the only meaning my life will ever have.\n\nIn my introspection I wonder, is that the point of these games? To be somebody more than what you could ever dream to be.\n\nElden Ring isn\u2019t a great video game because it\u2019s open world Dark Souls, or because it has excellent bosses. It\u2019s a great game because you are looking into a mirror.\n\nNot only does the story of Elden Ring reflect the history of our own world. It lets you choose how you would rule the world.\n\nBut for you to understand the choice you are making, you have to understand the default ending. \n\nIt\u2019s not super complicated, you mend the Elden Ring as close as you can to imitate the Golden Order. You won\u2019t ever live up to the Golden Order, but\u2026 well, you\u2019ve all played Dark Souls. It\u2019s merely a cycle.\n\nBut what does mending the Elden Ring in a default state mean? Well, look at the world around you. \n\nThe Golden Order was an undoubtedly a critique of the rise and the worldwide domination of Christian Capatalism. It is a critique of Amarika. And it\u2019s also a warning. \n\nThe Original Sin of Marika isn\u2019t so far off from Eves Original Sin.\n\nMetyr is the serpent that seduced Eve into usurping God. Once a child of God, she was abandoned, and so she became vengeful. \n\nThe Golden Order subjugates the Pagans through violence, they even use their own symbolism against them. They believe in one true god, they believe they are above the natural law. Marika is Crucified similarly to Jesus Christ.\n\nMarika has monopolized life and death. She created the Erdtree so that she could control who lived and who died based on how useful to the system they were. People could only have true death if they were accepted into the system. Kinda sounds like Heaven and Hell. \n\nBut it all backfired on her. The Omens arent just Hornsent descendants. They are the new, cursed Hornsent. A brutish reminder of the Crucible. The natural world fights back.\n\nAnd the most devastating blow to Marika, Godwyn. \n\nThe game states that the Shattering happened because of Godwyn. The lore community took this as an emotional reaction. I think it\u2019s a reaction of desperation. \n\nMarika didn\u2019t shatter the Elden Ring because she was sad that her son died. Fucking hell, Marika literally says \u201cif you are my son or daugher and you don\u2019t become anything then you will be SACRIFICED.\u201d \n\nMarika shattered the Elden Ring to stop Godwyn from usurping her. Deathblight overwrote Erdtree Burial. She didn\u2019t just lose her son, she lost control. \n\nMarika thought herself above death, she wanted to control it. But death isn\u2019t a belief. Death is life. \n\nRot; and Death may have been suppressed because of the removal of Destined Death, but the concepts didn\u2019t stop existing. They mutated into a twisted version of their natural state when given the chance. \n\nSpeaking of which, Fias ending was one of death restored. Not just Destined Death. But Deathblight as well. In Marikas attempt to weaken death, she made it significantly stronger. \n\nFia is the antichrist of Elden Ring. The one who would bring about the end of the Golden Order on a literal fundamental level. She is NOT bringing the world back to its natural state. \n\nDeathblight and Destined Death have the same source, but they are not the same thing. \n\nDestined Death was life and death controlled by the Greater Wills fate. With Deathblight you are God. You are the life and death within one vessel. You can\u2019t rot, you are no longer bound by the natural state. \n\nIf Deathblight was natural, it wouldn\u2019t be weak to Golden Order Fundamentalism which is a scientific study of the Greater Will.\n\nI believe you could most easily compare The Age of the Duskborn to Satanism. You are still within the order, but you become your own personal Greater Will. It\u2019s a story of self empowerment.\n\nBelieve it or not, the Dungeater is also a twisted part of Order. \n\nThe Age of Despair is the revenge of the Hornsent upon the Golden Order. In this ending you are forcing the entire world to be equally cursed together. Likely symbolic of Communism, we are all in it together equally. \n\nA lot of people view Goldmasks ending to be a continuation of the Golden Order. And to that end, you are both right and wrong. The Golden Order isn\u2019t just a religion, it is a science, it is as political stance!\n\nGoldmask does not abandon the science behind the Golden Order. He abandons the religion behind it. While he is still a Fundamentalist, he loses his faith in Marika and the Gods. Goldmask is an Agnostic Atheist. Order that isn\u2019t dictated\nby faith, but by science. \n\nThe last 2 endings are my favorite and by far the most complex.\n\nRannis Age of Stars is Anarchy. She spent her entire life controlled by Marikas Golden Order. I think in this way many of us can sympathize with her. But her circumstances were not that of a normal person; So she grew up not to hate Golden Order, but Order itself.\n\n\u201cThe certainties of sight, emotion, faith, will all become impossible. As it is now Souls and Order tightly bound, but I would have them at great remove.\u201d \n\nIn Rannis ending, we send the Elden Ring to the Stars. This is symbolic of us losing control over order. While it\u2019s true that Ranni is a love interest, it\u2019s important to see the bigger picture. The community didn\u2019t see this; So they added into the DLC this: \u201cOnze realized that the Procession of the Stars ended in ruin\u201d\n\nProcession: Follow in an orderly fashion. \n\nOrderly Fashion means the Elden Ring.\n\nThe Elden Ring ending up with the stars ends in ruin. Anarchy isn\u2019t really an option at the end of the day.\n\nNightreign shows us this. While the world may burn, Order has merely been abandoned; not destroyed entirely.\n\nThe abandonment of Order would be the Frenzied Flame. This is the nuclear option. You are not changing Order; Nor are the you abandoning it. You are destroying it completely. What is, will become naught. \n\nThis ending wouldn\u2019t even be an option if the world wasn\u2019t in the state it was in. This isn\u2019t just comically evil nihilism. This is cosmic balance. Karma. The consequence of an unfixable fundamental imbalance forced into the system. \n\nGo back and play the Ds3 DLC. We literally are the FF. The old order is desperately clinging onto power, and we are tasked with burning it all away so a new world can be born. \n\nI guess if I had to choose I would pick Goldmasks ending.",

    "body": "Imma speculate on where you find these and other lore about them. Here we go!\n\n**Cerulean Crystal Tears**\n\nRestores half of FP. We learn a) that the sap of erdtrees has the capacity to restore spiritual energy. We can acquires two of these, and when using the both, we restore all of our FP.\n\nThis 'two cerulean tears each giving half FP back' phenomenon seems to me to be a satisfying piece of evidence for 'two tree theory', which is the notion that in the distant past, there were supposed to be two erdtrees reigning over the LB (perhaps a tree of life and a tree of death). This second tree might be a spiraling tree around the Erdtree we know, or perhaps a tree to the far north (which is what I ascribe too).\n\nThe Haligtree is meant to 'be an erdtree', so we know this rival tree creation is possible to some degree. We even fight an erdtree avatar in Elphael, confirmation that the tree, even in its current state, is to some degree a proper 'erdtree' (or maybe it was in the past). \n\nWe find the left-facing Cerulean tear on the Western bank of Liurnia by a Minor Erdtree. Liurnia is the most 'spirit' energy-rich region, so I assume it is there by environmental causality. The western bank 'has always been associated with the Carian royals', implying extra moon-magic power for the whole region. It comes with the ruptured crystal tear, perhaps a clue that the modern Erdtree has lost its spiritual aspect.\n\nWe find the right-facing Cerulean tear on the Eastern peak of the Mountaintop of the Giants. We must find the duplicating Erdtree Avatar (two trees!). It comes with the crimson bubble tear (spirit and body, two trees!). These locations and instances of duality seem like further evidence for two-tree theory.\n\nThat we get a repeated tear in the North furnishes a hypothesis: the minor erdtrees in the mountaintops were grown from the Haligtree, or whatever tree it was before it was the Haligtree. Let's see if this receives further support.\n\n**Cerulean Hidden Tear**\n\nThis tear eliminates FP cost for a brief period of time. \n\nThe environmental storytelling looms large. We go down a slope of hanging troll corpses bleeding into the ground, past a wailing wormface, and reach the dying minor Erdtree only to meet an ulcerated tree spirit. These spirits almost always manifest around roots (rather than trees). The lack of avatar and presence of the spirit tells us just as much has been done to this minor erdtree. Has Rykard desecrated it out of malice? Or it he experimenting on it?\n\nSince, lacking an avatar, a 'spirit' forms, I'd imagine the Cerulean Hidden Tear is a spiritual manifestation produced upon this minor erdtree's death.\n\nGelmir is just above Caria Manor and has many architectural similarities with Raya Lucaria. Perhaps it used to be an astrologer hub back in the day.\n\n**Cerulean Sapping Cracked-Tear**\n\nThe DLC tears tell us something interesting, which is that tree-sap is not in any way antithetical to being put inside a forge and cooked. The glistening golden sap of the Scadutree... was it once in a giant forge? \n\nThis one restores FP upon attacking. We have a tree-looking fragment in the picture of the tear and swirly lines going into it - so a tree that is absorbing spiritual energy, that we end up behaving like. \n\nThis is an odd effect, unique (I think) in the game. There are several things that grant FP restoration upon death (Sword of Milos, Sacrificial Axe, and the Ancestral Spirit Horn). FP upon death means you siphon the spirit freed from its vessel. The spirit horn is a powerful vessel for the spirit; the Sword of Milos is perhaps, in some way, a living entity that still hungers; the Sacrificial axe is related to Ancient Death Culture that involves recycling and redistribution of souls and energy. \n\nCloser still is the Assassin's Cerulean Dagger. It restores FP upon critical hit. Perhaps in a strike so violent, some spirit can be gleaned... The Assassin's have all sort's of enchantments related to occult Destined Death rituals... Perhaps Destined Death operates by full absorption of vital life and spirit, so even a partial enchantment can grant such a powerful effect. \n\nThis Scadutee sap effect is stronger still. Its sapping effect is far more potent than the others described. \n\nSince the sapping is related to death/freeing the spirit from its vessel/Destined Death, then all I can conclude is that the Scadutree is uniquely close in nature to 'death of the spirit'. Whatever that means. Any ideas?\n\nOh, and you get it by Manus Metyr so the Carian's are close to this Cerulean tear as well. They really are the Cerulean faction.\n\nI'll do crimson's next time. Hope you had fun!",

        "body": "I think the whole point of Millicent's quest is about this.\n\nMillicent's whole journey is one of having her fate altered to suit an agenda. This is done through Gowry's manipulation of the Unalloyed Gold Needle, the needle being an instrument that can weave the thread of fate. Depending on the outcome of her quest, she either succumbs to Gowry's fate and dies with the Unalloyed Gold Needle in her flesh in order to bloom,  OR she takes out the Needle and succumbs to the fate she decides for herself:\n\n&gt; \"That if I am to flower into something other than myself, I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.\" (Millicent dialogue)\n\nShe leaves behind that same instrument which weaves fate if she dies rather than bloom. Only, instead of Gowry's designs this new version of the Unalloyed Gold Needle contains Millicent's designs as reflected in its new description:\n\n&gt; \"There is something I must return to Malenia. The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.\" (3rd version of the Unalloyed Gold Needle's item description)\n\nTo bring all this back to Malenia: after she has been defeated by the player and has bloomed, we can apply Millicent's version of the Unalloyed Gold Needle to Malenia's bloom. In doing so, we have weaved Malenia's fate and returned to her that sense of \"dignity [...] that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot\". This indicates to me that her fate will now be similar to Millicent's: she would \"rather rot into nothingness\" than \"flower into something other than\" herself. So why did Malenia bloom in the first place?\n\nIt is extremely important to note that by giving Malenia's bloom Millicent's Unalloyed Gold Needle, we necessarily pull out Miquella's Needle. I think that this indicates that, just like Millicent with Gowry's Needle, Malenia's fate was manipulated with Miquella's Needle. They are both Needles, instruments that weave fate. Both Needles are engineered by someone with an agenda. The Needles purportedly grant the impaled person relief from the rot, yet at the same time when the impaled person dies with the Needle in their flesh, they bloom. The parallels here are striking, and it isn't unreasonable to believe that Miquella wanted Malenia's rot power to slay Radahn for the sake of acquiring a Consort. There is also a precedence for Miquella manipulating wills through his charm, so why not through altering fate?\n\nIn short: if Malenia is given the Unalloyed Gold Needle she will likely choose to rot away into nothingness rather than bloom into the true Goddess of Rot. If Malenia is not given the Unalloyed Gold Needle, the next and third time she is killed/betrayed, she will likely bloom into the true Goddess of Rot.",

It's also directly said that her humanity is what kept the Rot at bay, so it would be likely that the Rot would consume her. \n\nAlso keep in mind that Malenia is an Empyrean that doesn't have a twin person or other. Her existence is evidence that supports Marika not needing to have had a twin personality or other half. I'm pointing this out specifically because people say that Marika had to have always had one and it was just naturally Radagon or the Gloam Eyed Queen or someone else.",

    "body": "You might think that FromSoftware pulled the entire Miquella plot in the DLC out of thin air, and that they never intended for him to be a central piece.\n\nBut you could also think that **FromSoftware did plan Miquella**, and that they told us about him as they usually do with everything: in a cryptic, disordered, and symbolic way.\n\nAnd, in fact, you can twist things to even maintain that they did so **from the beginning**, or that what they later rewrote simply molded itself to what was already consolidated. The first items, the first places, the first NPCs... your first steps in Elden Ring occur under the long shadow that Miquella casts.\n\nA large part of the community searches for the key to connect things in the literalness of the descriptions or in the visual motifs (heraldry, geometric patterns, architecture, etc.). I'm not saying this is incorrect, or insufficient. \n\nSimply, that there are more things, specifically **symbolic meanings**, that can also interrelate. And in the specific case of Miquella, what happens at the beginning of the game is quite striking.\n\n\n\n# 1. Chapel of Anticipation\n\n\n\nThe adventure begins here, in a chapel full of **spider webs** and with a dead Maiden. The interesting thing about this point is that if you manage to defeat the **Grafted Scion**, you can get a **Nascent Butterfly**, the first craftable item in the game. As you know, nascent butterflies are one of Miquella's symbols.\n\nMinutes earlier, you've already had your **first image of Miquella**. He appears in Mohg's arms. And if you look closely, it's not hard to think of **insects and cocoons**, because he appears refurbished in a series of quite creepy threads.\n\nIf Dorothy had to follow the yellow brick road, you will have to follow the path of the nascent butterflies. Because another **Nascent Butterfly** will catch your attention. You will try to reach it, but the ground will crack under your feet and you will die.\n\nFor many, this is a joke. For me, it is the **narrative anticipation** that the **Chapel of Anticipation** holds: it is the first hint about how **elusive Miquella** is going to be.\n\nAnd, in fact, this condition is further reinforced if you stop to think about the **Grafted Scion**. As the first enemy in the game, it is a formidable adversary. So, it is most likely that you won't even be able to notice all these references. You will be dead before then.\n\nIn the 1.0 version of Elden Ring, **Miquella** is referred to as the **Scion Empyrean**.\n\n# 2. Stranded Graveyard\n\n\n\nThe obvious thing is that, out of nowhere, **Torrent** and Melina appear; and there are close relationships between the mount and the demigod.\n\nThe less obvious thing, as with the name Chapel of Anticipation, is the name of the graveyard: **Stranded Graveyard**. But we all now know Miquella's passion for making **needles**, and what his **threads** can tie. Even wills.\n\n\n\n# 3. Varr\u00e9\n\n\n\nAfter falling in love with Limgrave, you will see **Varr\u00e9**. He is one of the trusted men of **Mohg**, the demigod you saw holding **Miquella** in his arms minutes earlier. The demigod whom we now know Miquella bewitched, and whom he needed to provide a body for Radahn's soul.\n\nSo, is Varr\u00e9 there on Miquella's orders? That is not the important question. The important question is the bond. We can connect Varr\u00e9 with Miquella through the **shared nexus** between them with Mohg. Even the **bouquet of flowers** Varr\u00e9 attacks us with reminds us of the young Miquella, the demigod associated with flowers, buds, and trees.\n\n\n\n# 4. Kale\n\n\n\nKale is the next NPC, and you will find him in the Church of Elleh. He is the first nomadic merchant in the game. The connections seem to weaken, although Kale belongs to a nomadic tribe recluded in the depths of Leyndell.\n\nYou will have to reach the **Cathedral of the Forsaken** to find the **Great Caravan**. Coincidence or not, **Miquella** has a plan for the forsaken. Coincidence or not, it is **Mohg**, the demigod Miquella has bewitched, who appears there. Coincidence or not, a **cut subquest** of the merchants tied their adventure to **Miquella and Saint Trina**, as well as the Frenzied Flame.\n\n\n\n# 5. Melina\n\n\n\nMelina will be waiting for you at the graces near the Stormveil gate, but canonically she will appear in front of the outer gates of Stormveil. She will give you **Torrent**, and she will also give you **the special whistle** to call him.\n\nAnd... yes, **Torrent** had a strong link with Miquella. The **delicate goldsmithing** of the Spectral Steed Whistle is a sign of this. The **DLC's cookbooks** are a sign of this. The **promotional image** of Shadow of the Erdtree itself is proof of this.\n\nSo, is Miquella Torrent's master? It doesn't matter. Again, what matters are the **connections**.\n\n\n\n# 6. Renna, the Witch\n\n\n\nYou will have been killed several times by now, but it's most likely that you will be again. And now that you have the horse in your possession, sooner or later you will end up resurrecting at the Church of Elleh and **Ranni** will appear.\n\nWith a sleeping Kale amidst a **purple mist**, the witch will give you the **Spirit Calling Bell** and your first **Spirit Ashes**. She gives them to you because the spectral steed's former owner gave it to Ranni for her to deliver to whoever Torrent chose.\n\nAnd whether or not Miquella was that former master... the truth is that there is a parallelism between **Miquella's mind control and summons**. We force the ashen remains of ancient heroes to fight for us, just as Miquella manages to attract to his side those he bewitches. In fact, **Miquella's Bewitching Branches** turn enemies into allies, and the mechanic is essentially the same as that of the Spirit Calling Bell.\n\n\n\n# 7. Roderika\n\n\n\nFollowing the route to Stormveil, you will run into **Roderika**. This is a fundamental character, and not just because she will upgrade the Spirit Ashes you can use with your calling bell. This link with the Spirit Calling Bell is reinforced because she will also give you your second summon: a **jellyfish** named Aurelia.\n\nRoderika will tell you that **the Spider** has killed all her friends, and that the spider waits in Stormveil Castle. And it's easy to think that the spider is Godrick. But you would be wrong.\n\n**Roderika's Spider is the Grafted Scion** in the Stormveil dining room. There, a lot of limbs hang from the ceiling, as if they were the chrysalides in which spiders wrap their prey. If you manage to get rid of that abomination of limbs emerging from an immense thorax, which only rises to attack (like spiders), you will reach a small courtyard.\n\nIt is there, in that courtyard and not in Godwyn's arena, where you will find the **Chrysalis' Memento**, **Roderika's friends** shrouded as if they were chrysalides, and a **hanging arm**.\n\nMetaphorically, this scene repeats **Miquella's presentation in his cocoon** in the Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum. And, in fact, Miquella is presented there as a half-made vegetable scion, as we know that cocoon was extracted from the huge cavity in the Haligtree, which shows his effigy on the trunk and a long arm that reaches everything. The same arm that hangs over the chrysalides in Stormveil, the same arm that comes out of Miquella's cocoon.\n\nBut you don't have to reach the final part of the game to see these semantic links. As soon as you started reading, you already saw a reference to **Miquella** next to another **Grafted Scion**: remember the **Nascent Butterflies** in the **Chapel of Anticipation** as a reward for defeating the abomination. And remember the 1.0 version: Miquella was the **Scion Empyrean**.\n\n\"If you're grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid,\" says Roderika. And this is a **poetic way** of mentioning Miquella's power, capable of dominating people's egos and turning them into just that, a shell that acts under his orders and where Miquella's will decides for them. As if it were an extension of his own body, this is Miquella's true grafting technique.\n\n\n\n# 8. Irina\n\n\n\nLike a true summer child, you will go to Stormveil. And neither Godrick nor the spider will be needed for you to decide to go in the exact opposite direction of the castle. Margit will take care of that.\n\nAnd to the south you will find a character who seems to act as **Roderika's counterpart**. Both are blonde, both appear seated, both are recognizable by their eyes: Roderika because hers are like Marika's, Irina because she is blind.\n\nOne guides you to the Grafted Scion. The other, to another form of monster built from grafting: it is the **Leonine Misbegotten**, a formidable beast composed of parts of different beasts.\n\nIts link with grafting doesn't end only in its form, since the reward for defeating it will be the **Grafted Blade Greatsword**. Later, in Stone Coffin Fissure, we will see another **Misbegotten** with a Haligtree spell guarding the place where Saint Trina lies. And, of course, we will run into **the ultimate leonine graft**, Radahn, that lion reanimated with Mohg's body.\n\nIf you recall, Roderika gave you the **jellyfish Aurelia**, and a series of jellyfish will lead you to the battle against the **Leonine Misbegotten**.\n\nIf you recall, Roderika spoke to you about **empty shells**, about **chrysalides**, and that is what **Irina's body** will be: an empty shell that **Hyetta** will take, and whom you will end up finding after the depths of the **Cathedral of the Forsaken**.\n\n\n\n# 9. Sellen\n\n\n\nBefore reaching Morne, there are three other characters who also have their own link with this whole body topic. The first of them is the sorceress **Sellen**. Her subquest, in fact, will revolve around the ancient power of astrologers to **occupy bodies** other than their own.\n\nOf course, Sellen's quest makes us think of Ranni. A witch occupying a puppet's body leads us directly to the lunar princess.\n\nBut with everything we know now, it is undeniable to establish comparisons. Because Sellen is precisely involved in a subquest with Seluvis to activate the **Radahn festival**. And this is where the link with Miquella can already be seen: of all the demigods who could be related to this plot, it is coincidentally Radahn. Not only is he one of the demigods you must defeat to access the DLC, he is one of the ones Miquella has chosen for the body \"exchange\". His puppet, however, will be **Mohg's body**.\n\n\n\n# 10. Yura\n\n\n\nAnd, again coincidentally, **Yura** appears. Yura's subquest seems to go in completely different directions from Miquella's plans, although from the outset his relationship with the bloody fingers allows us to establish a link with Mohg, the demigod Miquella keeps bewitched. But its climax refers us directly to elements related to the Empyrean.\n\nFirst, because his quest ends in the confrontation against **Eleonora**. And the loot for defeating Eleonora is, indeed, the Sacred Tear that warns us against **Mohg's Nihil**.\n\nIn fact, it is striking that during Yura's quest we face a unique enemy. It is the **Ravenmount Assassin**. And the striking thing is that his set can be obtained in a precise location, the **Sage's Cave**. And this place, in turn, is striking again because it is located next to the largest concentration of Miquella's Lilies in the entire game, whose door is flanked by Trina's Lilies and where you can find nascent butterflies and a shield that shows the Candletree, trees that are only found in the Haligtree and whose design is reminiscent of the weapon carried by the inquisitors in SoTE.\n\nThe color pattern of the **Candletree Wooden Shield**, blue and white, is only shared by one other shield in the entire game. [And it wouldn't be especially striking](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1m4xdkl/the_importance_of_meaning_how_elden_ring_lore/) if it weren't for the fact that this color pattern gives the **Blue-White Wooden Shield** its name. The description of this shield tells us that \"the design is said to **represent the stars of the night sky, portending fate**.\" \n\nIt is not difficult for this to make us think of **Radahn**, while the schematic nature of the stars carried by the shield recalls **Mohg's rune** and his **trident**.\n\nFinally, because when we thought **Yura** was already dead, we will see someone occupy his **body**. A madness.\n\n\n\n# 11. Blaidd\n\n\n\nBut if we talk about madness, we cannot overlook talking about Blaidd. Linked to Ranni and Kale, who will give us the gesture to interact with him, the truth is that **at the end of his quest Blaidd will go mad**. His body will stop responding to his own will.\n\nAnd he will end up imprisoned in a jail. In fact, the same one where his quest begins: **Darriwil's**. The truth is that the fight against Darriwil is a **foreshadowing** of what will happen with Blaidd. But also of something else.\n\nBecause Darriwil belongs to a lineage of knights who are characterized by **not being able to betray their masters**. Their will is so ironclad that, once they decide to pledge loyalty to their master, they keep the promise until the end of their lives. Or at least that's what his armor set tells us.\n\nBut this was not the case with Darriwil. **Darriwil turned against his master**, even though that was not part of his nature. However, we do know someone who can make your will bend. It is **Miquella**. Coincidence or not, this type of enemy will be the one guarding the access to Latenna, the Albinauric connected to Albus, the secret medallion, and the Haligtree itself.\n\nAnd, again, the key is not whether Miquella bent Darriwil's will, but in the symbolic link that can be established between them.\n\n\n\n# 12. TLDR (Too Long; Didn't Read)\n\n\n\nIf we start the game by facing a Grafted Scion who protects nascent butterflies, we will end it facing a monster also composed of different parts whose will has been severed. Consort Radahn is the definitive grafted scion, where grafting reaches its greatest and most terrifying splendor: Radahn's soul grafted onto Mohg's body under Miquella's control.\n\nMiquella is the central character of the Elden Ring DLC, but even so he is an elusive figure. At first glance, everything in Elden Ring seems chaotic and meaningless, but once we know its narrative we can find seeds that will bloom later. Miquella's prominence is such that even when nothing seems to link directly to him, a small thread leads us to something that, at least symbolically, is related to him. Perhaps that is why FromSoftware also decided to link him with needles, knowing how scattered all the threads were.\n\nWhether it was a premeditated initial idea or simply the way to \"graft\" Miquella's plot into a broader world, it seems that there is more than simple coincidence behind all this. This beginning, once we know the narrative of Elden Ring, is an announcement of what is to come.",

There's a really good book The Chrysalids by John Wyndham about a transitional form of humans living in the society of the currently dying out form. A chrysalid in this case is the thing inside the cocoon, not the cocoon itself.  Aurelia is a synonym for chrysalid, so then little jellyfish can be seen either as the cocoon or I think more likely the transition state, the thing inside the cocoon. She is trapped between one plane and the next, living in a dying world and waiting for the world to come. If you think about Miquella they are in a transition state, the realm of shadow like a cocoon and Miquella the chrysalid, wanting to emerge on a new plane.",

Gideon may have deduced that virtually his life's work has all been for naught and/or said \"Oh, the Queen wants Godfrey on the throne? You got it boss.\"\n\n2. Gideon is very pro-status quo and very pro-order in a way that it often seems like Marika isn't.

    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "There are 3 \u201cOuter Gods\u201d that exist on a universal scale. They are the very creation and destruction of the universe, they are the universe itself. The One Great, the Greater Will, and the Frenzied Flame. \n\nThe One Great can most easily be described as the original state of the universe. It is the DnA of reality. The paint in which the Greater Will dips its brush, to paint order onto the void. The Greater Will itself is the canvas in which it paints on. An endless void that fractured the One Great, and from it, created the universe. \n\nBut there cannot be absolute order without absolute chaos. What is borrowed from the One Great must be returned, this is cosmic balance. What the Greater Will creates, the Frenzied Flame destroys. Recycling the material back into the One Great, for the Greater Will to use again. \n\nThis is why all things can be conjoined; because all things come from one singularity, from one will, and eventually we will return back to one. \n\nWhen people think of all things being one, they often think of a singularity, but what\u2019s Inside of this singularity? In Elden Ring, all things, all thoughts, all concepts like physics, life, light, dark, matter. Everything that can ever exist, all exists simultaneously in this state of one. You would imagine that this would be quite chaotic right? Impossible physics blending together with any possibility of matter or ideas. This is Chaos with the potential for Order. \n\nYou could loosely consider the One Great a living being. Within it exists the potential for life, and sentience. But I think it\u2019s more accurate to describe it as a Crucible. A state in which all things exist blended together. \n\nFor some unknown reason, The One Great fractures, and splits into two halves. The Greater Will and the Frenzied Flame. Absolute Order and Absolute Chaos. \n\nI theorize that within the crucible of the One Great, after potentially trillions of years of chaos, the right mixture of sentience, life, physics, concepts, etc got blended together at just the right time, and within this moment, the being that it created was essentially able to tear open the singularity. But that\u2019s just one of many possibilities. \n\nThe Greater Will is the creator of the entire universe. It is the being that fractured the One Great, and from it created everything. \n\nYmir: \u201cLong ago, we began as stardust, born of a great rupture far across the skies. We, too, are children of the Greater Will. Is that not divine? Is that not sublime? ...and yet, none can fathom its implications, its utter brilliance!\u201d\n\nHyetta: \"All that there is came from the One Great. Then came fractures, and births, and souls.\n\nBut the Greater Will made a mistake.\nTorment, despair, affliction... every sin, every curse. Every one, born of the mistake.\u201d\n\nHyetta and Ymir\u2019s dialogue both heavily imply, if not outright say that the Greater Will is the one that fractured the One Great and created the universe.\n\nBut what *is* the Greater Will? Put simply, it is Order. Not like, the Golden Order, or Rannis order, but literally the incarnation of the concept of order. From the Crucible of the One Great, it took the chaos inside, and created order. Which resulted in the universe we find ourselves apart of. \n\nElden Remembrance: \u201cIt was the vassal beast of the Greater Will and living incarnation of the concept of Order.\u201d (Elden Beast)\n\nElden Stars: \u201cIt is said that long ago,\u00a0the Greater Will sent a golden star bearing a beast into the Lands Between,\u00a0which would later become the Elden Ring.\u201d\n\nSo why is the Elden Beast important? Well first and foremost, it is extremely important that it\u2019s described as the living incarnation of order. Second, it\u2019s equally important that it later becomes the Elden Ring. The Elden Beast is the Elden Ring!\n\nFor those of you who really know your lore, you might have picked up on me calling the One Great the Crucible. So what is the Crucible?\n\nAspect of the Crucible Horns:\n\n\u201cOne of the ancient Erdtree incantations.\n\nThis is a manifestation of the Erdtree's primal vital energies - an aspect of the primordial crucible, where all life was once blended together.\u201d\n\nSo just as the One Great is the universe blended together, the Crucible is all life blended together. And just as the Greater Will created Order out of the One Great, so did the Elden Ring create order out of the Crucible. This is not a coincidence. I\u2019m sure if you have been around for a while you\u2019ve heard \u201cas above, so below.\u201d \n\nI theorize that the Crucible and the Elden Ring is the Greater Will emulating the creation of the universe on a smaller scale, to create life. The Crucible is the microcosm of the One Great, and the Elden Ring is the microcosm of the Greater Will. \n\nHigh Priest Hat: \u201cThe hat of Count Ymir, High Priest. The circular design at the top represents the Greater Will and its lightless abyss, imparting increased intelligence and arcane to the wearer.\u201d\n\nWhy exactly is the Greater Will a lightless abyss? My main theory is because it needed to have a canvas to paint on, and so it became the canvas. The reason it appears as a lightless void, is because it is literally the fabric of space time, and so it cannot be visually perceived by human eyes as anything but a lightless void. \n\nI personally don\u2019t believe that the Greater Will abandoned the Lands Between. I think the Lands Between abandoned the Greater Will. \n\nElden Ring is a criticism of our own world, it\u2019s a historic tale of how the western world has forsaken nature for an entirely artificial life. Just as Marika has destroyed the natural way of the world, in order to create an artificial monopoly over life. \n\nThe Greater Will, and the Elden Ring didn\u2019t exist in opposition of the Crucible. They existed together in a harmony that Marika disrupted. \n\nWe see it in the Elden Ring itself: https://imgur.com/a/R1ubmCB\n\nYou can see clear as day that the Ancient Elden Ring has the Crucible inside of it.\n\nPastor Miriel: \u201cOh, what have we here? Very well, let us both learn together. Heresy is not native to the world; it is but a contrivance. All things can be conjoined.\"\n\nMetyr and Marika wanted the power that the Greater Will had. They tried to become the very life and death of TLB. They wanted to be absolute gods! \n\nMan cannot control nature, as we see. Marika is unable to contain the crucible despite her best efforts. Hornsent stop getting born, instead they are born as Omen. An Omen to Marika that she is taking the path of destruction. \n\nThat destruction is the Frenzied Flame. Absolute Chaos. Order cannot exist with Chaos. The concept of absolute Order cannot exist without some sort of balance. So the Frenzied Flame serves a purpose beyond just being a cartoonishly evil villain. It exists because Order must include balance, that balance is decay and rebirth on a cosmic scale. Recycle the old so new can be created. \n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Thats fine, do you believe Golden Order Fundamentalism? \n\nThere are 2 fundamental laws that we know of. I theorize there are more, as Golden Order Fundamentalism is explicitly a science.\n\nThe Law of Causality: Causality is the pull between meanings; that which links all things in a chain of relation. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just cause and effect, this is destiny, this is fate, this is grand design! Ymir will tell you something pretty similar. \n\nThe Law of Regression: Regression is the pull of meaning; that all things yearn eternally to converge. \n\nCausality is the link, and regression is the goal. It is the PULL of meaning. And the meaning is, for all things to become one. Not just that that all things become one, but that all things eternally yearn for it. I think the implications of this are a lot bigger than people give it credit. This is literally the Frenzied Flame. The fate of the universe is for it to return to one again. \n\nThey even put it in the item description for Miquellas needle: \u201cCapable of subduing the flame of frenzy if inherited, allowing one to CHEAT FATE and avoid becoming Lord of Frenzied Flame.\u201d\n\nMiyazaki explored this same concept in Ashes of Ariendel. That\u2019s right, this isn\u2019t the first rotting world you\u2019ve burned. Did you forgot about your \nold Corvian friend? https://imgur.com/a/QOpj7Qv\n\n\u201cSurely you've seen the rot that afflicts this world. But that witch fooled the good Father, and buried the flame. After we had all made up our minds, too. So, please, grant us one wish. Make the tales true, and burn this world away. My Lady must see flame, and you have only to show her.\" \n\nWhen you compile all the evidence up and take a look at the world around you, I think it becomes evident that we have found ourselves at the end of the world, perhaps life\u2019s last hope for redemption. \n\nSo what ending do you choose?

My belief from this stems from the trailer where Godrick the Golden, Lord of Stormveil says \"O' Elden Ring, shattered by someone .. or something.\" \n\nAfter listening to this and comparing it to the game it does not seem many of the Demigods in the game either are aware of the fact Marika the Eternal shattered the Elden ring, or in my belief; they refuse to believe it. Many of them bare lineage of Marika's demigod blood, if not directly then through Radagon. Godwyn wouldn't count, who was felled in the plot of the Night of the Black knives orchestrated by the Empyrean, Lunar Princess Ranni. All the ones who would be closely tied to the relations of the shattering of the Elden ring however, we do not get any dialogue pertaining to the shattering but from the fact many across the lands between and the fingers are set on the idea(and moreso the fact) that Marika the Eternal shattered the Elden ring and triggered a major tipping point of the shattering, it seems many of them refuse or have no reason to believe that Marika truly shattered the Elden ring. \n\nPeople like Morgott, the Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell, who are close the Erdtree only arose from the Subterranean shunning grounds close to the beginning of the Shattering of the Elden ring and the war that would ensue. Praetor Rykard, whom forces are locked in war with the Erdtree and it's faithful, would possibly be ill-concerned with who or what shattered the Elden ring. Lady Ranni most likely knows who did considering she has a direct hand in the events leading to the Shattering, and Miquella the Unalloyed I presume, is also aware and hence used it to trace Marika the Eternals roots of power back to the gate of Divinity. \n\nThe flaws with this, is that the trailer could be referring to a time when the shattering was believed to be an unknown occurrence and so not directly known that Marika the Eternal shattered the Elden Ring. Another one being that I do not have direct dialogue proof to ascertain the possibility that the demigods do not believe that Marika the Eternal shattered the Elden ring, only simply believing it was an unknown force that would cause its destruction which could be why it feels like many of them no longer have any subscription to the Golden Order and by extension the Greater will(I say greater will and not the Erdtree because it does sound like that Godrick the Golden most likely still believes in the blessings of the Erdtree) BESIDES Morgott, the Grace-given, which would make sense as he had only just arisen from Leyndell's boughs, possibly not that long after the Elden ring was shattered and just before the scale of the Shattering took hold. \n\nWhat is everyone else's thought on it?

If they cast their dead downriver, those remains would eventually contaminate the water and the coast.\n\n- if we know that the Aspects Of the CRUSIBLE Sprouted amongst giants, how then did it spread over to humans? \n\n\u2022 \"You Are What You Eat\": We see over and over that creatures in Elden Ring are susceptible to what they consume (Glintstone, Rot, Deathroot). I think the \"Omen\" curse (horns) comes from consuming the remains of the dead.\n\n\u2022 Herbivores vs. Carnivores: Some creatures may have developed horns from a carnivorous diet (eating the dead directly), which might explain why they are haunted by spirits. However, even herbivores in the Land of Shadow sprout horns. This suggests they are getting the curse from the land itself\u2014plants and water infused with these remains.\n\n\u2022 The \"Fell\" Link: It\u2019s interesting that the Omen curse is also referred to as \"The Fell Curse.\" Since the Fell God was worshipped by the Giants, this gives us a direct linguistic link between Omen/Horns and Giants.\n\n\u2022 The Lamenters: This fits perfectly with the Lamenters, who suffer a severe version of the curse. The backs of their heads look disturbingly like a Giant\u2019s face.\n\n\n\nPerhaps this contamination is the way the Giants\u2014or the Fell God\u2014are attempting to return to the Lands Between. \n\n(As we know you cannot TRULLY kill a god, you can trap it but even the god of rot managed to come back from being sealed away eventually, re-emerging as \u201cScarlett Rot\u201d) - unless you have a god slaying weapon I guess  \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to think this, but I\u2019m curious if you guys have insights I overlooked. What do you think?",

The herbivores of the Rauh Ruins also manifest not just horns, but the unique Spirit Calculuses. Predatory beasts who sit at the top of the hierarchy are the ones who devour other horned beasts, with the accumulation of divine vigor turning them into deific figures. \n\nHornsent culture, and the culture of the realm of shadow at large, center around doing things that typically stand apart as \"unclean.\" Their key practices center around undertaking, butchering, jailing, and execution. All things associated with various lower/outcaste groups in Japan, particularly a group called  'Burakumin' who were an outcaste group in Japanese society. It was composed of people who did certain jobs, and the label was inherited, regardless of what work their offspring (or **their** offspring) did. I think horns, and the cursed blood/filth that they are tied to, are the result of being exposed to death and blood. The Hornsent are kind of like Burakumin, who have taken to embracing the manifestations of their \"impurity\" as signs of divine favor.",

    "score": 52,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "Placidussax's tornado was the ancient crucible :\n\nI've never seen this outwardly stated but i believe this is self evident considering a multitude of facts, in game cultural symbology mainly found in stormveil, farum azula, enir ellim, the black keep, belurat, the weeping peninsula and Caelid.\n\nI mean if you just use occam's razor you'd come to the conclusion that there's probably a deep connection between the crucible-storm-worshipping-animal-dancing hornsent and the primordial elden lord, ruler of beasts, resting in the eternal storm, Placidussax. I mean there's literally nothing other than storms and beasts in Farum Azula.\n\nI just started another playthrough, my first one in a while and it's ridiculous how different Stormveil, limgrave and Nepheli's quest feel after finishing the DLC. What i used to think were just throwaway lines, early game loot from small caves and inconsequential naming conventions now cement my feelings that no one does the archeological fantasy game better than fromsoft.\n\nIn the base game i've always thought the war with the ancient dragons had a weird conclusion, the decree that worship of the ancient dragons was not outside of the realm of the golden order or rather that ancient dragon worship doesn't contradict worship of the erdtree. I used to think it was merely a peace plan executed by Godwyn to stop the war. But no. Elden ring is not only a fantasy but the grim aftermath of millenia of political drama and that's an aspect i don't really see taken into consideration in some theories.\n\nI believe the dominant cultural forces before the erdtree were primarily was called the sun realm by people like Granulous Goldmask. An empire caracterised by ritual combat, burning of the dead, dragon communion and storm worship to venerate the ancient dragons as the holders of the crucible, the source of all life, and the only beings capable of eternal life. I also believe that the old gods were completely annihilated by the same meteor shower that hit Farum azula. That would explain how the old gods were forgotten about while the dragons persisted.\n\nWe know that the elden beast came into the lands between on a shooting star, and that Metyr was the first shooting star to come to the lands between. Either Metyr came with the ring or the ring came after Metyr. Eitherway, Placidussax was the elden lord of that age, meaning he was the consort of whatever had the ring. Either Metyr or the elden beast itself, with Metyr serving as a guide. Ancient dragons have rock scales that lightly distort time, making them excellent in making long lasting tools and structures. A scale of Placidussax is even called a necessary ingredient in making a godslaying weapon. Some people disagree when saying placidussax was an actual elden lord, saying it's just naming and that Godfrey was first elden lord. I would disagree that the giant dragon that spits GOLDEN fire, whose flesh is made of rock and GOLD, capable of ETERNAL LIFE and rests in AN ETERNAL SPIRAL OF WIND isn't a goddamn elden lord. The elden ring depiction in Farum Azula and the finger pose Placi does with his two heads helps too. \n\nThe spiral and the storm are heavily worshipped by the hornsent, the spiral as a standardized crucible current that stretches to the heavens and the storm as the most ancient signifier of divinity. Meaning they consider one as interlinked with the other. The primordial crucible being a giant tornado is also supported by the euporia's skill and siluria's tree. Meaning that before settling as the erdtree, the primordial crucible was a life giving tornado that stretched to the heavens. This goes so deep into elden ring beyond the hornsent that even Godrick asks a drake, a descendant of the ancient dragons, to deliver him onto greater heights through the wind. Nepheli, a descendant of Horah Loux, finds comfort in the ashes of the storm hawk king, like the hornsent look to their mummified ansestors holding spirit ash for guidance. These are cultural practices that Horah Loux kept alive as a warrior before his crowning, and after his banishment. The burning of the dead is still a practice in the lands of shadow used by messmer in the black keep. The shadow keep itself is not a creation of Messmer or his soldiers imo, but a repurpused castle that was dedicated to burning the dead, as the boats are filled with ash and have the exact same design as the boat of the tibia mariner. We even see in Enir Ellim that there's statues of a boat which are copy pasted from the alabaster boat of Tutankhamun. Another thing is the helphen steeple sword that looks very similar to the steeples of the black keep.\n\nAll this yapping was to prove that there are deep ideological and cultural ties between the ancient dragons, storms, divinity, the crucible and the hornsent. While the hornsent don't partake in dragon communion, the banished knights, the fighting forces we see all over the lands between, from stormveil, to caelid, to the mountaintops and Farum Azula clearly do. We don't see banished knights in the DLC but Gaius's arena is littered with them, nowhere else, and this time we don't have the excuse of late development changes to blame for banished knights equipment being everywhere. They were either massacred or spared thanks to Niall's and O'Niel's bargain to serve the erdtree. The exile soldiers are also covered in thorns, a sign of the guilty.\n\nThere's also the idea of the divine beasts, loosely identified entities that embody the spirit of wildness of the crucible and with divine control over storms, these are most likely not just one being for example. So the divine lion isn't necessarily just Serosh, but the idea of lionhood birthed from the eternal storm of the crucible, and we have literal proof of ritualistic combat against horned lions in colosseums, roar of rugalea seems to support this too. the divine bird may also be related to the twin bird but that's unrelated for now.\n\nThe sun realm had territory all over the lands between, Belurat and enir Illim, the shadow keep, Castle sol (sun) in the mountaintops to fight the ice drakes, castle morne (morning) in the peninsula, stormveil, and multiple forts in Caelid to fight the drakes.\n\nSo practically all the good real estate in the lands between.\n\nThe war over godhood :\n\nSomething that I didn't get about the war with the ancient dragons is the motive. For all others you can find a decently formulated reason by the game or at least speculate on why with ok levels of proof. But when it came to the dragons who reside surronding an eternal tornado alone it didn't really hit me until i realized that Marika basically led a continent wide revolt against the forces of the dragons aka the sun realm, democratized immortality, which was the biggest advantage the dragons had over every other creature on the lands between and has the elden ring that the ancient dragons lost when Placidussax's god fled. For the dragons, this was a war over influence all over the land and who gets to be the God kings of the lands between, a status the ancient dragons held forever.\n\nAfter the attack on Leyndel by Gransax, it must have been obvious for both sides that this war was one of mutually assured destruction so since the roots of both factions were the elden ring, Leyendel would guarantee worship of the ancient dragons continue while the dragons would assist the golden order by teaching their knights lightning incantations and sending priestesses to their capital to continue dragon communion. By the same occasion, Marika's shadow would hold the rune of death in Farum Azula. This can also explain why Marika felt it was necessary to shroud the jagged peak in the realm of shadow to permanently remove Bayle and Metyr from the picture.\n\n ",

The \u201cCrucible\u201d is source of power and life and all things in TLB, but it\u2019s \u201cpresence\u201d or what have you, *moves*.  I believe you are right that Placidusax\u2019s tornado was the Crucible during his Age of the Dragons era.\n\nLater, the Crucible was attributed and \u201cpresent\u201d at Enir Ilim (Crucible Knight Devonia set out to find the Crucible and she ends up in Rauh staring off at Enir Ilim in the distance). Then later when Marika ascends and begins her own Empire, the Erdtree is then the source and place of the Crucible.\n\n What this essential means is that the Crucible was never actually just a \u201cdish\u201d in a metaphysical space; the common denominator to all these relocations come down to one thing. The Elden Ring is the Crucible.\n\nPlacidusax was consort to the vessel of the Elden Ring (either Metyr, the Beast itself, or whichever), so where he lived was also where the Elden Ring was: the tornado.  His god fled and the ER then lost to Placudisax, and it was not recorded in history thereafter for a very long time.  Eons later, Marika approaches the gates atop Enir Ilim and presents herself through them to ascend; the ER enters her body as its new vessel. The ER was above/near/in Enir Ilim until then.  Then Marika begins her conquest across TLB, starting with her war on the Fire Giants. It\u2019s during this war that the Erdtree is born and her first church erected. The Erdtree is grown \u201cof the Crucible\u201d and remains its home until the Tarnished arrives to either keep it there or send it back out into the cosmos.\n\nThe motive for the Dragon War you put forward also makes sense. They lost the position of dominant race when the ER zipped off, but they couldn\u2019t find it again until it took a new host. The Dragons attempting to assault Leyndell to win back the ER for their \u201cright to rule\u201d again fits perfectly well in logic, and the decided end to that war being recognizing one another as allies through truce also works. \n\nGreat post!",

Then I looked at the Scadutree Sunflower description, and something clicked.\n\n*\"The head of a monstrous shadow sunflower manifestation of the Scadutree. Then again, it might be just a flower, wielded as a weapon. Much like the Scadutree itself in appearance, a second stalk winds tightly around the first, almost as if in a tender embrace.\"*\n\nThat phrase \"a second stalk winds tightly around the first\", seemed straightforward at first. Obviously referring to the two trees. But the picture becomes clearer when you examine other Scadutree-related descriptions. The Impenetrable Thorns sorcery reads:\n\n*\"Sorcery of those who abandoned the practice of incantations after devout faith rewarded them with only despair. The caster wounds their own flesh using impenetrable thorns grown from the Scadutree, which then sprout from the earth. This sorcery can be used repeatedly. The image of the twisted Scadutree is an edict: Denounce their ways. Do them harm. For they have abandoned us.\"*\n\nNotice the specific word choice: \"twisted Scadutree.\" The Mantle of Thorns sorcery goes further, describing it as a \"misshapen tree.\" Now look at the Scadutree itself in the Shadow of the Erdtree. While both trees appear damaged, only one actively twists and wraps around the other, bending it. The game's own description reinforces this:\n\n*\"The Scadutree is the shadow of the Erdtree. Born of dark notions that bear no sense of Order, that twist and bend its stock, rendering it brittle.\"*\n\nIf only one tree is doing the twisting and that tree is explicitly the Scadutree, then the tree being strangled must be the actual Erdtree. This might explain why the Erdtree we see in the Lands Between appears largely holographic, a projection rather than physical reality. The real tree is elsewhere, wrapped in the Shadow's embrace.\n\nThe brittleness mentioned in the description also explains the Scadutree Fragments scattered throughout the Land of Shadow. The twisting motion didn't just bend the tree it broke it, sending shards bursting across the region.\n\nThen there's St. Trina herself. Look at her form\u2014she appears as a twisted stalk, bending and coiling just like the Scadutree. The visual parallel is unmistakable.\n\n[She appears like a twisted stalk. Like the Scadutree, which makes sense, she is after all, Miquella's shadow ](https://preview.redd.it/9z6xi44wkn2g1.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fe6ca67d0a62403e099802b96ab661d2fd2e01e)\n\n[The Sealing Tree, The Actual Scadutree](https://preview.redd.it/vdpt7eh4qn2g1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=020e60bc3389077a689fc1759c03f19213a44ae7)\n\nBut that would also mean that the Sealing Tree (at the Church of the Bud) could represent the Scadutree before it was placed fully in shadow or at least, a prior state of the same entwining principle before it overgrew its host. That raises some questions though.\n\n* What is the Sealing Tree\u2019s relationship to the Erdtree?\n* Is \u201csealing\u201d a synonym for \u201cshadowing\u201d or \u201csuppression\u201d? If \u201csealed\u201d = \u201cveiled in shadow,\u201d then sealing might be the *method* by which shadow overtakes, binds, and twists an original form.\n* What does that imply for the suppressing pillar in the Lands Between? If suppression/sealing is a technology or rite, does the pillar enact the same logic in another register?\n* Why do both burnings send us to skyborne spires? Burning the Sealing Tree sends us to Enir-Ilim; burning the Erdtree sends us to Farum Azula. Two spiral towers in the sky.\n* Why do both rituals map onto Rauh? The Sealing Tree sits in the Rauh Ruins beyond the church of the bud; the Forge of the Giants (which lets us burn the Erdtree) sits atop Rauh\u2019s remnants as well.\n* What does it *mean* to be \u201cshadow\u201d or \u201cveiled in shadow\u201d? We meet shadow-bound beasts, and both Hornsent sites and Farum Azula share a design language of coverings and shrouds; hangings, drapes, veils. Architecturally, shadow seems to *layer* and *wrap*, the same way the Scadutree wraps its host.",

    "score": 43,
    "subreddit": "EldenRingLoreTalk",
    "body": "Radagon of the Golden Order remains a mysterious character. Through the game we find out that the current Elden Lord, Radagon, is also missing like Marika. And the reason is because he  IS Marika, he's her other half.\n\nBut apart from this, he also appears to take some actions that indicate he has motivations entirely of his own, separate from the motives of Marika.\n\nAs you learn more about him, starting mainly in Liurnia, you begin to spot similarities to the Norse myths of Loki, the Trickster God. These comparisons, when lined up, start to implicate Radagon more deeply in the events of the game... especially the Night of the Black Knives and the Shattering.\n\nHere's all the ways Radagon and Loki are similar:\n\n1. Both have red hair, a physical trait of the giants in ER and also the Jotunn in Norse myths. Loki is the son of a Jotunn and Laufey, a tree goddess (interesting)\n\n2. Both married a giant of a woman (Rennala, Angrboda) and conceived of three children who all turned out to be monsters:\n\na. A giant snake (Rykard, Jormungandr)\n\nb. An all-consuming beast who will attack anyone (Radahn, Fenrir)\n\nc. A goddess (Ranni, Hel) whose face is half alive, half dead, and rules over the underworld. (Ranni's quest does force the Tarnished to explore most of the underworld beneath The Lands Between)\n\n3. Both Radagon and Loki may have shapeshifted and sired children with monsters. The Red Wolf of Radagon (why else \"of Radagon\"?) and the Misbegotten Crusaders are prime examples. The one in the Cave of the Forlorn is carrying the Golden Order Greatsword, which was clearly a weapon Radagon forged. (BTW, this sword is clearly a desecration of the Moonlight Greatsword, which would have been given to Radagon by Rennala per Carian custom.)\n\n4. Both Radagon and Loki left the giant woman and returned to the pantheon of the gods (Lyndell, Asgard) and married a goddess (Marika, Sigyn).\n\n5. Both Radagon and Loki had two more children with their new wife, which were ill-fated. Malenia and Miquella were both cursed with perpetual rebirth and scarlet rot. Loki's children with Sigyn, Nari and Vali (who might have been twins but it's unconfirmed) were both ill-fated during Raganarok, as one was transformed into a wolf and tore out the entrails of the other. The ill-fated twins in ER get a slightly better storyline, thankfully\n\nSo what do all these similarities point to? If Radagon really is so similar to Loki, then like Loki orchestrated the death of Baldr and triggered Ragnarok, was Radagon more involved in the death of Godwyn and the Shattering than anyone in the game has knowledge of?\n\nThink about it; when we enter Ranni's service she admits she orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives. She says she stole the Rune of Death from Maliketh, forged the Black Knives, and carved the half cursemark on her own flesh. But she never mentions Godwyn, nor his death. The only time she actually mentions it is in the ER story trailer, outside of the game. But, she doesn't even know how to get into Nokron, which is where the Black Knife assassins hail from, no? The Tarnished has to go ask Sellen how to get there, and it is she who says the Tarnished must kill Radahn to free the stars so they may crash to earth and reveal the entrance to Nokron. Ranni doesn't suggest any of this.\n\nThe Nox, from whom emerge the Black Knife Assassins, are all in Nokron. (Except for a couple in Selia.) If Ranni had no access to the Nox, then how did she distribute the Black Knives to the Black Knife Assassins? And why are they now trying to kill and silence Ranni and her friends?\n\nI think it's quite possible that, like Loki arranged the death of Baldr, Radagon was the true orchestrator of the Night of the Black Knives. His motive was the undoing of Marika's emotions by killing her most beloved demigod child. Like she says to him in her bedroom, Radagon is not yet like her, not yet a god... meaning he wanted to be one. By exploiting his daughter's resistance to serving the Two Fingers, he convinced her to sacrifice her body so that Godwyn's soul could be destroyed, which is the closest he could get to actually killing a demigod with the Rune of Death still sealed.\n\nWhy Godwyn? Because Radagon was most likely feeling a little outshined. He invaded Liurnia twice to try to steal magic from the Carians, and failed both times. He then convinced Rennala to marry him by wiping her memory using Celestial Dew (another tool of the Nox, btw). He stayed in Liurnia and learned magic as quickly as possible, using his Radagon Icon to cast magic faster. He then abandoned Rennala and Liurnia and returned to Leyndell, to teach sorcery to the Golden Order. He created new Incantations that utilized Intelligence as well as Faith, and tried to strengthen the Golden Order. However, his followers turned into zealots who started capturing and torturing heretics, similar to the Inquisition of the middle ages.\n\nMeanwhile Godwyn leads the Golden Order forces against the Ancient Dragons when they attack the capital. He defeats Fortisax in battle and rather than kill him, befriends him. He brings Dragon Lightning incantations back to Leyndell, and starts the cult of Dragon Incantations. When you explore Leyndell you realize; the Dragon Incantations are performed to this day and the Golden Order Fundamentalist incantations of Radagon's are not. I think this made Godwyn a favorite of the capital. And since Loki is well known for his jealousy, maybe Radagon is jealous too.\n\nIf you've made it this far I'd love to hear your thoughts. I made a video about this on my YouTube channel, but it doesn't seem to have reached the Elden Ring community for whatever reason. Let me know if you'd like me to share a link.",

Because that\u2019s also where it all culminates.\n\nHe stands at the crossroads of every major narrative thread, metaphysical contradiction, and divine influence. And the usual explanation that he was simply a former servant or champion of the Golden Order does not cut it. It feels far too shallow for someone positioned at the heart of so many cosmic strands. In that sense, from a metaphysical standpoint, he seems like the true nexus of the entire cosmology, not just as a god but as a structural idea as well.\n\nI\u2019m working on formalizing this theory but I\u2019m still missing some insights. The main gap is that we know almost nothing about Radagon's true origins. I get the sense that if even a small piece of that background were revealed, all the connections I'm seeing would snap into place. Meanwhile we actually have more information about almost every other major figure, including the Outer Gods and how they define or oppose one another on an ontological level.\n\nAnd there is also another layer I'm trying to understand. I suspect there is a very deeply hidden connection, something that might be truly foundational for both Leyndell and Farum Azula, between Radagon, Placidusax, Gransax, and Bayle. If that link could be clarified in terms of timelines or the placement of certain events, I believe it would define the entire structure of the mythos. But right now, that part is still blurry for me. So I'd appreciate any theories on that front.\n\nAt the moment, my view is that the real key is to understand Radagon fully. If his origin, his nature, and the true depth of his purpose (rather than just the appearance of it) were made clear, the whole Elden Ring cosmology would likely resolve into something much more coherent.\n\nAs a side note, I\u2019m also trying to get some perspectives on how Messmer's placement in the Land of Shadow ties back to Radagon, whether narratively, symbolically, or metaphysically. If anyone has thoughts on that connection, it would help me form a clearer picture. Any input would be appreciated.",

        "body": "My interpretation of his character is quite simple: \n\nMarika had to undergo the same process as Miquella and Ranni, who both discard their mortal bodies to \"purify\" themselves and become vessels for divinity. Both are then only spiritual beings - encompassing mind, intellect, faith and the arcane, unshackled by natural/bodily/earthly  physiology - who can then \"ascend\" into a higher realm by absorbing divine energies. \n\nMarika also underwent a process of purification (which may have also killed her...) through the jar rituals of the Hornsent, where she was separated into a cleansed heavenly/spiritual half (Marika) and an impure earthly/bodily half (Radagon). Their natures and the domain of their powers (mental/spiritual vs physical) are reflected by their colours and Soreseals. Since Marika's soul is the actual vessel of the divine energies, and she had control over the four spiritual \"stats\", she could control and shape the divinity inside her into the form of the Elden Ring, reshape its form and properties, as well as later destroy it. \n\nThis obviously left Radagon in a bunch of existential torment, since he was \"born\" as an inherently impure chimera composed of every part of her body and soul Marika discarded to become a god - forever separated from her, yet also bound to her for eternity. He hates himself, he hates his own \"nature\" (both his origins and what he's actually composed of - the \"natural\" parts), and his whole schtick is about becoming as far removed from himself as possible. \n\nThis is why he learns incantations (faith), later moves to Liurnia to master sorceries (intelligence), tries to combine the two in a unified philosophical system, and is completely obsessed with all manners of order, symmetry, purity, balance, divinity, etc. Because they're antithethical to his chaotic earthly nature. He is born as an impure physical \"tool\" of Marika's heavenly \"mind\", and so tries with all his might to become (more like) her - and replace her. \n\nBut his self-hatred is also his eventual downfall: because he hates all natural and chaotic things, he despises and never learns the arcane, which is crucial for control over the Elden Ring. This is why he can't repair it in the end, and poetically ends up as what he fought so hard against his whole life - a mindless weapon,  a physical tool controlled by the intent of higher powers.",

The goal of this thought experiment is to create your own Age using all the lore in Elden Ring. Though we can debate what canon endings are the best and worse, I want to see what is possible when gameplay restraints are removed. In a sense I want us to go beyond Ranni, Miquella and the Dung Eater tell me what age you would create. \n\nFor example: Let's say our Tarnish likes both the age of perfect order and the age of duskborn. We get ahold.of the elden ring and bring about the Age of the Duskborn but after adding the mending rune we add goldmasks mending rune ensuring the Age of the Duskborn cannot be tampered with. ",

You kill everything, even the healthy plants and animals, with fire or madness, both of which show players and NPCs in more agony than anything else, even rot or acid.\n\nThe best thing you could do would be to work with some priests and mages to use the Rune of Death to kill Godwyn\u2019s body all the way and stop the spread of deathroot. Then put all the runes back into the Elden Ring with Goldmask\u2019s mending rune and let the ring deal with nature. Then create your own set of human laws and policies, like forbidding the mistreatment of misbegotten, albinaurics, demihumans, and omens (and forbidding revenge by those groups), bringing in large numbers of sane people from outside the Lands Between to rebuild, building good relationships with the dragons to burn back the range of the scarlet rot and maintain a firewall against it, forbidding the study of magics that require killing people (making graven masses and grafting), filling the frenzy pit with rocks and sewage, having historians write down all the recently learned information, including how the Greater Will effed off when it was needed the most to discourage blind allegiance to it or any other faction, etc.\n\nThe \u201cgod\u201d is reduced to merely a vessel, no longer in any kind of mental control. If the Greater Will wants to get rid of you and put some other soon to be abandoned Elden Lord in charge, make sure everyone knows how fickle the GW is and that the fingers have been making stuff up for the last 5,000 years. Also keep Ranni in your back pocket to take the ring away if the GW or any other messed up faction tries any such shenanigans.",
